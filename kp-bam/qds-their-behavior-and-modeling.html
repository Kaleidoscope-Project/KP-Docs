            When reasoning about and discussing behavior of discrete action systems at the
            everyday level regardless of be they living organisms, devices created by us,
            or systems of computer programs that imitate behavior of the both, we basically
            pay attention to the actions which these systems perform. And that is understandable.
            We know which of the actions would  make no harm (and even are useful) to us,
            or, on the contrary, be quite dangerous; and this is exactly what is important
            to us in the context of our conversations about the acting systems. But while
            studying the essence of mechanisms of behavior of the systems, we want to know
            not only what kind of actions systems can perform; we want to understand why
            they perform those or other actions. And for that, it is necessary to know what
            actually happens in the system right before it activates the actions and right
            after the actions that were performed and which we observed are completed.

                Nature of Behavior of Qualitative Dynamical Systems
            </p>

            <p>
                Analyzing the nature of the observed behavior of various qualitative systems, for the purpose
                of learning the mechanisms of the organization of their actions, we can distinguish three
                basic types of behavior and thus three types of systems.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>The first</b> type of behavior is characterized by the complete absence
                of any reasons arising in the system that could cause activation of actions.
                All actions in these systems are carried out in accordance with the
                plan which these system have. The content of the work of such systems thus
                includes: sequential (or even concurrent) activation of the actions, tracking
                the moments of completion of the actions activated, determining a single or several
                next actions in accordance with the plan, after the previously activated actions
                are completed, and activating next actions.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>The second</b> type of organization of behavior of systems is the exact
                opposite of the organization of behavior of systems of the first type.
                Behavior of these systems is organized
                in accordance with their behavioral goals, to achieve which the systems
                use all available and potentially accessible knowledge about themselves
                and the world around them. These systems are living organisms of varying
                degrees of complexity.
            </p>

            <p>
                Every decision made by such systems and every action they perform is almost always
                unique, since it arises in accordance with once-existing circumstances
                that will never arise again. Therefore, studying and attempting to create
                the models of such systems having intention to reproduce in them unique behavior of the
                systems is not only impossible, but merely does not make any sense.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>The third</b> type of organization of behavior of system differs
                from both: the behavior of the first and the second systems in that it
                is not based on any plan and is not
                organized for achieving any goals; simply because these systems have no
                plans and no goals for organizing such behavior. All what they have
                is a limited collection of their properties, the state and changes
                in the state of groups of which characterize situations to the
                occurrence of which the systems is supposed to react with actions.
            </p>

            <p>
                The behavior of that systems is perceived as the emergence of chains:
                Situation - Action - Change in the state of the properties of the system.
                In these chains, Situations that may arise in the result of the own activity
                of the systems and under the influence of the environment surrounding the
                systems cause responses of the systems in the form of activation of actions;
                activated Actions produce changes in the state of the properties of the
                systems, and the produced changes accumulate and ultimately form into new
                situations, to which the systems respond with new actions that produce
                new changes in the state of the systems, etc.
            </p>

            <p>
                The content of the Kaleidoscope project is an attempt to explore the
                nature of the behavior of qualitative dynamical systems of the third type
                in order to develop a mathematical modeling technique that formalizes the
                process of creation of mathematical models of the behavior of these systems.
            </p>

            <p>
                And the first step in developing this technique is determining a way of description
                or the correspondence of observed changes in the state of a system to
                emerging situations - i.e. creation a specification of the observable
                behavior of the system, which is the basis for both the search for the technical
                solutions in determining the technique for modeling systems, and for creation of
                models of original systems based on the modeling technique developed.
            </p>

<!--            <p>-->
<!--                To do this, we consider the causes, i.e. the state and changes in the state of the system-->
<!--                itself arising from the interaction of the components of the system with each other and-->

                Qualitative Dynamical Stsrems Behavior Specification
            </p>

            <p>
                Studying behavior of qualitative dynamical systems with the intention of acquiring understanding
                of its mechanisms and creating models of the systems capable of reproducing the
                behaviour under various initial conditions and influence on the systems of their environment,
                involves description of the above-mentioned schemes of causal dependence of changes in the
                state of individual properties of the systems, obtained as a result of passive observation of
                the behavior of the systems and test experiments conducted with them.
            </p>

            <p>
                Being, in contrast to the schemas that describe specific reactions of systems to the
                occurrence of specific situations, description of process of the entire behavior of the system
                i.e., behavior over a certain period of time) must contain all individual dependency relationships
                of the properties, but at the same time, describe the behavior of each property depending
                on the occurrence of all situations that determine their state. In fact, description should serve
                as a specification
                of the state variable function of the model, which will then be created based on this description.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hence, the specification of a QDS should be created as a list of specifications of the behavior of
                each of the properties of the system, where the specification of a property should be
                organized as a property
                name followed by the list of descriptions of schemas defining a pair: state of property - a
                description of the situation in which the state of the property specified by the first element of the
                pair can become the new current state of the property. An example structure of the specification
                describing behavior of an abstract property <b>p0</b> is shown in Figure 1.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 11pt; text-align: center; ">
                p0 = [p1 = A) & (p2 = B) & (p3=C)], [p4 = A) & (p5 = B) & (p6=C)], [p7 = A) & (p8 = B) & (p9=C)];
            </p>

            <P>
                Presented specification describes dependence of the property <b>p0</b> on the facts of occurrence of
                three situations, each of which is characterized by three particular states of three other properties.
                So:<br>
                (1) the occurrence of a combination of the state <b>p1=A</b>, <b>p2=M</b>, and <b>p3=G</b> represents a
                situation the occurrence of which determines that the next state of the property <b>p0</b> can become
                the value Y,<br>
                (2) the occurrence of a combination of the state <b>p4=A</b>, <b>p5=M</b>, and <b>p6=G</b> represents a
                situation the occurrence of which determines that the next state of the property <b>p0</b> can become
                the value Y, and<br>
                (3) the occurrence of a combination of the state <b>p7=A</b>, <b>p8=M</b>, and <b>p9=G</b> represents a
                situation the occurrence of which determines that the next state of the property <b>p0</b> can become
                the value Y.
            </P>

            <p>
                Performing not just a random observation of the behavior of a qualitative system, but
                conducting its systematic and organized study with the aim of subsequent development
                of a model of its behavior involves the creation of an accurate description of
                all situations, the occurrence of which causes reactions of the system and all
                changes in the state of the system happening as a result of the reaction.
            </p>

            <p>
                And since the purpose of this description is to enumerate all changes in the state of each
                property occurring due to the arising of a particular situation, the content of the specification
                should be represented as a list containing the name of the property as its first element and
                a list of correspondences associated with this property as a second element; where each
                correspondence is presented as pair first element of which is the description of the state
                of the property and the second is the description of the situation emergence of which
                causing the change of the properties to the state described in the first element of the
                correspondence. Visualization of the provided quite cumbersome description of the structure
                of the specification is presented in figure 1.
