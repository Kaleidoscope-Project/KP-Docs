            <strong>Application Modes and Screen Layout</strong>
            <p>
                This page is a brief description of Qualitative Dynamical Systems Development & Simulation
                Environment backed by some screenshots. This Environment is a full-fledged Java desktop
                application that utilizes McLN graphical modeling formalism for design, development and
                simulation of qualitative dynamical system models. Respectively, the application can be
                set to operate in either Development or Simulation mode. In both modes menu item
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:bold">View&nbsp;=>&nbsp;Graph</span> or <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:bold">View&nbsp;=>&nbsp;Matrix</span> can be
                selected to represent McLN model as either bipartite oriented graph, or as a collection
                of mathematical vectors and matrices. By default, the application is started in
                Development mode and is set to represent developed model in the form of Graph View.
                <b>Figure 1</b> represents DSDS DSE initial screen - when the application is just started.
            </p>

            <center>
                <p><br><img src="app-screenshots-small/Started-Application-Small.png"/></p>

            </center>

            <a>
                The application screen layout includes following (from top to bottom): Menu and Toolbar, Application
                Status panel,
                Design Space, Assisting Tools Area, and One Line Message panel. Design Space is the McLN
                Graph/Matrix View
                holder.
                In usual case McLN Graph View occupies all Design Space area. In addition to McLN Graph/Matrix
                View, user may open one of three optional right side panels, such as: Initialization Assistant, Help
                Topics,
                or Preferences Setup panels.
                Print Preview panel may optionally replace McLN Graph/View space by taking left and central area of
                Design
                Space on the screen to present Print Control
                panel on the left and Print Preview panel in the center of the screen.
            </a>

            <h4>Development Mode</h4>

            <p>
                While in Development mode, the Environment allows McLN model developer to create McLN Graph, set
                Properties initial state, initialize Arcs with their Expected or Generated states, save partially
                created
                or complete model on hard drive, retrieve it, modify, and save again. The application produces McLN
                file
                that is intended to be retrieved by Space Exploration Mission application into its Robot Behavior
                Controller.
                <b>Figure 2</b> represents Project Space Graph View filled with developed Three Rules McLN model and
                the Initialization Assistant - a wizard like tool - open on the right side of the Design Space.
                <b>Figure 3</b> represents same Three Rules model in Matrix View.

            <p>
                User switches Environment to Development mode by selecting menu item
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Development => Set Development Mode</span>.
                Switching to Development mode enables
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Creation</span>
                and <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Modification</span> menus.

                Available under <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Creation</span>
                menu operations are to create:
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Property Nodes</span>,

                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Move Model Fragments</span>,
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Move Entire Model</span>, and
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Delete Model Elements</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                When in Development mode, the Assisting Tools Area contains Summery panel that lists the summary of
                the model elements by type, providing for each type the number of created in the model elements
                and the range of the UIDs used so far.

                Presented in the Matrix View McLN model is drawn as five elements - three vectors and two matrices,
                where:
            <ol class="justified-text">
                <li> State Vector is the model input vector representing McLN model Properties current state.
                </li>
                <li> Condition Vector is the representation of the state of model Conditions.
                </li>
                <li> Suggested State Vector is the vector representing the change of some Properties state that are
                    supposed be merged into State Vector before it is used as the model input at the next simulation
                    iteration.
                </li>
                <li> And Matrix represents each Condition's state dependency relations from the state of Properties.
                    It is used to map model StateVector to Condition Vector.
                </li>
                <li> Or Matrix represents each Property's state dependency relations from the state of Conditions.
                    It is used to map model Condition Vector to Suggested State Vector.
                </li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
                Although both Creation and Modification menus are enabled while the Design Space is set to be in
                either
                Graph or Matrix View,
                all creating new or modifying existing model elements operations can be applied when the
                model is presented in Graph View only. The McLN model Matrix View currently serves for visualization
                purpose only.
            </p>

            <h4>Simulation Mode</h4>

            <p>
                While in Simulate mode the Environment allows McLN model developer to test developed model behavior.
                When switching to Simulation mode the Assisting Tools Area is filled with following panels: Property
                Selection panel,
                Property Current State panel, and Execution History Trace Log panel. These are currently available
                tools
                assisting
                in the McLN model development, debugging and verification.
                <b>Figure 4</b> represents DSDS DSE screen snapshot when the Environment is in Simulation mode while
                Help Topics panel Running Model Examples is optionally open on the right site of the Design Space.

                Located below Design Space simulation analysis tools allow user to select all or subset of model
                Properties
                and analyse model behavior over time. The Model Current State Panel presents each selected
                Property current state and provides its interpretation in the form of statement, including
                Property name as the statement's subject and presenting the value of the Property current state in
                the form of the statement's predicate. The Execution History Trace Log panel presents selected
                Property
                states
                history over simulation time. Both panels are updates after each simulation tick in real time.
