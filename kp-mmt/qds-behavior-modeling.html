                While studying behavior of the dynamical systems phenomenologically (that is not by
                delving into their internal machinery, but instead considering only the abstract
                collections of properties of the systems, changing over time) we, following the
                fundamental principles of mathematical modeling technique, tend to explain causes of
                changes of properties of the systems by existence (in the systems) of certain
                dependence relations of state of the properties on the changes of the state of some
                other properties of the systems.

                described further on as a complex of coordinated modeling solutions defining the way of creation of
                models of qualitative dynamical systems by describing them as collections of qualitative variables,
                representing qualitative properties of modeled systems, on the one hand, and describing dependence
                relations of states of the properties on the situations arising in the systems by representing this
                dependence, in the models, in the form of mathematical qualitative functions computing dependence of
                their values (and, thus, the states of the variables) on the states of other variables (characterizing
                situations) that are given as the arguments of the functions, on the other hand. Solutions to these
                challenges are described below.

            <p>
                Perhaps the first most question related to the model defining solutions should be
                "How the model intended for simulation of the behavior of a qualitative dynamical system is
                supposed to be defined" and the answer to this question should sound as one of the solutions:

                    <p>
                        The model should be created as a collection of variables representing properties
                        characterizing behavior of the existing or designed modeled qualitative system. These
                        variables should be capable of representing qualitative states of the modeled properties
                        as symbols taken from some set of symbols, for instance, the set of letters of some alphabet.

                Then the behavior of the model being created for reproducing behavior of the qualitative dynamical
                system that is observed as the sequence of changes of the state of properties of the system, caused by
                occurrence in the system situations characterized by the particular states of particular groups of
                properties,
                could be described in the form of the system of equations; the same form that is generally used to
                represents dependence relations of the quantitative systems:

                equations, obvious differences in the way of representation of quantitative and qualitative properties

                Representation of States of Qualitative Variables
            </p>

            <p>
                Being, in general sense, mathematical functions, function describing dependence of a variable
                of the model on the states of other variables of the model are the mathematical functions defined
                on the domain set of the function mapping combination of their argument to single value that is
                also belong to domain set. These values are the representation of facts that being represented by
                the values states of any particular variable characterize some particular qualitative estimate of the
                state of the represented in the form of the state of the property of the model system and therefore
                is the indicator of the fact that the modeled property is in one of the possible and distinguished
                states, that the variable may take. As it is going to be described later the only sense of the elements
                of a
                set used to represent states of the variables is to be unique
                So, said out comment on the meaning of elements of the domain set of the functions of the model is

                This obvious and simple, but yet conceptual representation solution suggests defining
                qualitative system model domain set as a set of symbols.

                <em>Quantitative</em> Properties and Modeling Quantitative Systems
            </p>

            <p>
                We all are well familiar with the systems all properties of which, chosen for modeling, are perceived as
                numeric (i.e. may be referred to as quantitative) and the four algebraic systems defined on the sets of
                integer, real or complex numbers. The numbers have a notion of quantities and as the quantities can be
                added, subtracted, multiplied or divided, four defined on the sets operations, called: addition,
                subtraction, multiplication and division, allow us to add, subtract, multiply, or divide the numbers.
                Thus, we have powerful modeling means, making it possible to represent modeled systems’s quantitative
                properties as a collection of quantitative variables, and to describe the dependence of the values of
                the variables from the values of other variables in the form of well defined mathematical expressions.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another way of perceiving the systems and their behavior is to describe them in terms of, as they say,
                their qualitative estimates or, in the other words, by describing them in the form of statements that
                serve as the properties’ qualitative assertions and thus lets us referee to the properties as

                <em>Qualitative</em> Properties and Modeling Qualitative Systems
            </p>

            <p>
                As with modeling of quantitative systems, mathematical modeling of systems all chosen for modeling of
                which properties are qualitative, - i.e qualitative systems, implies defining a way of representation of
                the modeled system’s qualitative properties as qualitative aka symbolic variables, specifying the
                dependency relations of the variables, and describing a machinery providing reproduction, in the model,
                behavior observed in the modeled system.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, the properties of symbols that are elements of sets of homogeneous symbols turn out to be quite
                different from the properties of numbers that are elements of homogeneous sets of numbers.
            </p>

            <p>
                The main property of numbers used in calculations is the fact that for each pair of numbers belonging to
                a certain numerical set, each operation defined on the set can always be associated with the third
                element of the set, which is the result of the operation. This property of numbers and operations with
                numbers makes it possible to create compositions of operations and thus perform calculations of
                functions of a rather complex nature.
            </p>

            <p>
                The properties of symbols and operations with symbols, in comparison with the properties of numbers and
                operations with numbers, are more limited and the possibilities for creating compositions of operations
                are less diverse. In contrast to the properties of numbers that allow one to associate a third number
                with various pairs of numbers, based on the interpretation of the elements of numerical sets as
                quantities that can be added, subtracted, multiplied and even divided, symbols that are elements of a
                set of symbols do not have any interpretation and are used as markers to designate various unique state
                of qualitative variables have only one property corresponding to their application. Each symbol of a
                set, by definition of the notion of “set,” is a unique element of the set and therefore can only be
                equivalent to itself and, as a consequence of this, is not equivalent to any other symbol of the set.
            </p>

            <p>
                The consequence of this characteristic of symbols belonging to a homogeneous set of symbols is the
                absence of any possibility of direct generation for any two symbolic arguments of a binary operation
                with symbols of a corresponding resulting symbol of the operation.
            </p>

            <p>
                So, for instance, binary operations defined on a set consisting of only two symbols solve the constraint
                problem simply. They simply do not overcome these restrictions. As we know, the total number of binary
                operations defined on a set of two elements is 16. And none of these operations generates during
                operation its output element that does not exist in the set. All 16 operations are defined in such a way
                that no matter what combination of values of the operands of the operation turn out to be, they all
                always produce the value of one of the operands as their result, thus solving the impossibility of
                producing any third value.
            </p>

            <p>
                The resolution to this limitation, as we all well know, however, exists and consists in the inclusion in
                the process of computation some auxiliary symbols that can be used for representing the intermediate
                results of comparison of the arguments of the function, which can be used to indicate cases when the
                compared symbols turn out to be the same, opposite or different.
            </p>

            <p>
                The implementation of not direct, but, so to speak, indirect transformation of two characters into a
                third one in the case of following the described approach, of course, implies the implementation of the
                inverse transformation of the auxiliary symbol into the symbol corresponding to the symbol-values of the
                arguments. As it was found by experiments on defining operations on an extended set of symbols, carried
                out in order to confirm the existence of an operation on this set, one argument of which is a constant
                representing the produced symbol, and the second contains a previously calculated auxiliary symbol and
                yields the produced symbol in the case when the auxiliary symbol represents fact that the previously
                transmitted in the comparison operation, two characters were compared or, alternatively, the value of
                the second argument represented by a symbol indicating that the characters being compared turned out to
                be different. When continuing to calculate the final value of the function, the auxiliary symbol
                obtained during its calculation must indicate that the function is partially defined, the auxiliary
                symbol must be ignored, and the current value of the state of the model variable calculated using the
                described technique must remain unchanged.
            </p>

            <p>
                The reasoning about the properties of symbols and the proposed solution given in this section are based
                on the idea of expanding the domain set of the model by adding to it a set of auxiliary symbols that are
                the basic solutions that determine the development of techniques for mathematical modeling of
                qualitative dynamical systems. Development of this approach described here is described further in the
                sections devoted to determining the requirements for the operations of an algebraic system of operations
                which are used to determine the functions describing the correspondence of variables of the system model
                to the situations arising in the system, and in the section describing the Algebraic system determined
                taking into account the developed requirements for them.

                And in order for all of this to work well, the set of symbols should be a carrier set of
                the algebraic structure operations of which could be used in the definition of the functions

                The key element in this description of the basis of the technique of modeling of qualitative
                systems is the understanding of the need to have an algebraic system whose elements can be
                used to mark the states of model variables representing qualitative states of the modeled
                properties, and operations for computing the changes of the states of variables by
                replacing one symbols with the others.

            <p>
                This section first takes a look at the way of defining qualitative functions in the
                form of an algebraic expression written as a composition of algebraic operations
                defined on a set of symbols. Then it describes the process of computation of the
                expression as a sequence of steps that transform the qualitative values of arguments
                of a function into the qualitative value of the function and identifies the sense
                of the actions on symbols, necessary at each step of the transformation, that the
                operations of the algebra performing these actions have to implement. This section,
                thus, is the source of specification of the algebraic system that is defined and
                described on the page: The Algebra of Symbols. The page: The Algebra of Symbols
                is also referred to from the main page.

                To specify a discrete function, in general sense, means to define a way of computing
                the values of the function for all possible combinations of states of its arguments.
                Accordingly, following the existing culture of mathematical thinking, it is possible
                to suggest the way of defining the mechanism of computation a qualitative function
                of qualitative arguments that is supposed to be based on the idea of description of
                the schema of computation of values of the function in the way similar to description
                of schema of computation of the expression that is defined as well known Disjunctive
                Normal Form, but is enriched with ability to operate with the variables capable of
                taking several different states and to return the value of function that is one of
                those different values which the state of being computed variable may take

                So, if to assume that the operations with symbols., described in this section,
                may be denoted as {?, &, *, |, <}, where:

                <li style="margin-top:7px;">
                    symbol "?" denotes the Equivalence operation;

            - then the content of the procedure that should calculate the qualitative

                <p>
                    Whatever types of properties of the modeled systems were considered - quantitative or qualitative,
                    when creating mathematical models of these systems, we proceed from the understanding that
                    all actions and changes in the state of a system itself, or in its external world, that are
                    produced by the organized actions of the system, are always determined by the state in which
                    the system is, at the time of performing the actions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Therefore, in order to reproduce the behavior of the qualitative systems in the mathematical models,
                    we consider observed dependencies of the state of the properties of systems on the occurrence
                    of certain combinations of the state of other properties, characterizing situations to which the
                    systems react by changing their state. To achieve this, we define a model of a system as a
                    collection of variables representing properties being modeled and the states the properties may
                    take, and associate with each variable a variable state equation v(t+1) = f(v(t)), where the
                    function f computes the value of the variable at time t+1 depending on the state of the system
                    (a combination of the state of other variables of the model of the system) at time t. This makes
                    it possible to reconstruct, with the help of the model, the chain of the changes in the state of the
                    simulated system, observed in its behavior, by repeatedly computing the state equation of the
                    system after each change in the state of the model.

                    While performing various calculations with the quantitative variables, in order to control the
                    course of the calculation process depending on the state of the data, we often have to calculate
                    logical estimates of the truth of various assertions about the state of the data. And then, in
                    the course of the further computation, we check the truth of those assertions in order to direct
                    the process of the computation along the computational branch corresponding to the state of the
                    data. There are, in this process, data on the state of the domain area of the function, from the
                    one hand, and the metadata data state of which characterizes the computational process, on the
                    other hand. These two types of data are not homogeneous. Therefore, when computing, we utilize
                    for calculation only the operations defined on the set of numbers, but never mix them with
                    operations defined on the set of symbols.

                    Computation of Qualitative Functions
                </p>

                <p>
                    To compute a discrete function means to determine its value for each combination of the states
                    of its arguments. The method of setting such a function for computing discrete dependencies of
                    variables that can take only two values: 0 and 1 is well known. Mechanism of such computation
                    is described in the form of the so-called Disjunctive Normal Form and is implemented as two
                    major steps. First, all expected combinations of state of the system are computed. For that,
                    the conjunction operation, defined on the set {0, 1}, is used. And then, at the second step
                    of the computation, the disjunction operation is applied to combine all the results produced
                    by the conjunction operation. The result of the computation can be value 1, in case when at
                    least one of the results of application of all conjunction operations appeared 1, or the value
                    0 when none of the situations is recognised. But the modeled properties of the qualitative
                    systems can take not just two, but several states, and this assumes that the state functions
                    of the variables of the qualitative system model must be multivalued. And hence, the operations
                    used to compute the functions must be capable of taking as their arguments and yielding the values
                    of multivalued variables. In other words, they must be defined on the set of symbols, the power
                    of which would allow representing all possible states of the modeled properties.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Along with this, when recognizing situations represented by a set of symbols, we also must
                    compare the current state of variables with their expected state, note the facts of comparison
                    (or non-comparison) of expected values; calculate the conjunctions of the obtained comparison
                    results, check the facts of situation recognition and generate new values of variables
                    corresponding to the recognized situations and change the state of the system in the case when
                    the situation turned out to be present in the model and the fact of its existence made it
                    possible to generate a new state of the variables corresponding to the recognized situation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As it follows from the described scheme, the calculation procedure does not directly transform
                    the state of its arguments and the value of the function but uses auxiliary variables that
                    provide the calculation of the function but are not the result. Allowing that symbols can
                    be used to represent the results of a comparison creates a unique opportunity to define a set
                    of the algebra as the union of these two sets, and to define the operations required to
                    evaluate a function, which will make it possible to define a function as a composition of these
                    operations. And thus combine the process of calculating the function of the state of the
                    system and the process of conditional calculation of the result of the function into one
                    process that calculates the function as an unconditional process of calculation and in which
                    the calculation control logic is implemented by the operations that perform the transformation
                    of the state of the system.

                    An analysis of the properties of operations defined on sets of symbols, the number of elements
                    of which is more than two, shows the futility of trying to determine special operations (their
                    number should increase along with the increase in the power of the set), but revealed the
                    possibility of calculating multivalued symbolic functions if a number of auxiliary symbols
                    {} are included in the set, and adding to the function calculation scheme three additional
                    operations named: Equivalence, Production and Application.

                    To specify a discrete function, in general, means to define a way of computing the values of
                    the function for all possible combinations of states of its arguments. Accordingly, following
                    the existing culture of mathematical thinking, description of mechanism of computation a
                    qualitative function of qualitative arguments should be written as а kind of Extended Disjunctive
                    Normal form enriched with ability to operate with variables capable of taking several different
                    states and return value of the function that may also take several different state.

                Representation of Qualitative Dynamical System Model as Matrix State Space Equation
            </p>

            <p>
                This mathematical modeling technique utilizes an approach based on the notion of vector space
                of the modeled system. The variety of the states of a modeled qualitative system is
                characterized by the multitude of combinations of the state of its qualitative properties
                and therefore can be naturally considered as a qualitative state space of the system.
                Respectively; the state of the model of the system can be considered as the vector in
                the state space of the system; the changes in the state of the model can be viewed as
                the moves of the vector from one point in space to another; and the entire behavior of
                the model may be seeing as a sequential discret motions of the vector along a dynamically
                determined broken-line trajectory.
            </p>

            <p>
                And correspondingly, the modeling technique intended for describing the behavior of the systems,
                within the framework of this modeling paradigm, presents the models in the form of a vector state
                equation of the system, which describes the process of changing the state of the system in the
                form of the algebraic expression consisting of the sequential application of operations of
                transformation of the current state of the model into its next state. Whereas, the procedure
                for calculating the equation is supported by an algebraic system defined on the set of symbols,
                called Algebra of Symbols. The operations of Algebra of Symbols are used in the implementations
                of the vector operations of transformation of the state of the system.
            </p>

            <p>
                The general form of such equation can be written as a two-step matrix equation, presented below.

            <p>
                Idea of creating a model of dynamical systems was always welcomed. This idea began to
                take shape even when most computer monitors were alphanumeric, and only a relatively
                small part of vector monitors allowed to display on their screens some elements connected
                with lines - mostly monochrome. Now, when huge raster screens of modern monitors make
                it possible to depict whatever you want, the technique of creating a model of systems
                in the form of the elements and the links connecting them opens up even more new
                possibilities. And the Kaleidoscope project did not stay away from this movement either.

            <p>
                The graph is constructed of two types of nodes - Property-nodes representing modeled
                properties and their states, and Condition-nodes representing conditions at which
                the Property-nodes change their states. Property-nodes are drawn as big circles and
                their states are depicted as different solid colors that fill the circles.
                Condition-nodes of the graph are, on the contrary, drawn as small circles. And as
                the conditions represented by them may be either satisfied or not satisfied, the
                state of the Condition-nodes is depicted as either white or gray color, where the
                white color represents the case when condition is satisfied, while the gray color
                represents the opposite case, i.e. the case when condition is not satisfied. Directed
                Arcs connect Property-nodes to Condition-nodes.
            </p>

            <p>
                Arcs directed from Property-nodes to Condition-nodes are Recognizers. Their task is
                to recognize the expected state of the arc’s input Property-node and transfer the
                result of recognition to its output Condition-node. In order to be able to accomplish
                their roles, these arcs are marked with the color known as the expected state
                of the input Property-nodes of the Arc.
            </p>

            <p>
                Arcs directed from Condition-nodes to Property-nodes are Generators. Task of these
                Arcs is to generate the proposed next state of their output Property-nodes.
                Respectively, these arcs are marked with the color representing the state described
                in the specification of the response of the modeled system to the situation fact
                of the recognition of which the Condition-node of the arc is supposed to represent.
                Color marking the Arc is generated as the proposed state of its output Property-node
                in case when the state (white color) of the input Condition-node of the Arc indicates
                that states of all input Property-nodes of this Condition-node are recognized as
                expected states. Alternatively, that is in the case when the expected situation
                represented by the input Property-nodes of the Condition-node is not recognized,
                the Arcs directed from Condition-node to its output Property-nodes send them state
                (gray color) indicating the fact that the situation expected by the Condition-node
                is not recognized and thus the output state from this Condition-node should be
                ignored.

                Behavior of the McLN Model
            </p>

            <p>
                When describing McLN model behavior, we consider all parts of the model: Properties,
                Conditions and arcs to be simple functional devices. Thus, each part has its input and output and
                is capable of receiving a signal of a state as its input, processing the signal, and emitting a
                derived signal as its output. A model is assembled by connecting the outputs of parts to the
                inputs of other parts. For instance, the outputs of the nodes are connected to the inputs of their
                output arcs, and the outputs of the arcs are connected to the inputs of their output nodes.
                The Property nodes' basic function is to take and to hold the property's current state.
                The arcs from Properties to a Condition are "State Recognizers". The marking state of an arcrecognizer
                is one of the arc's input Property's possible states that is considered to be the Property
                Expected State. The role of these arcs is to check if the arc's input Property's state is equal to the
                arc's Expected State. When Property takes the state that is equal to the arc's expected state, the
                signal of the fact that the Property is in the expected state is emitted to the arc's Condition.
                The Condition nodes are their input arcs' output collectors. They take signals from their input
                arcs and evaluate whether the condition is satisfied. The Condition is considered to be satisfied

                when all its input Properties take the states that are successfully recognized by the Condition's
                input arcs as the arcs' expected states.
                The structure composed of a Condition, all its input state recognizing arcs, and all
                the arcs' input premise Properties forms a fragment that is a rule condition
                evaluating expression. The combination of all Properties states is considered to be a
                situation the rule is supposed to recognize. The output of the fragment is the
                Condition's state that represents the fact that the expected situation is recognized or
                not recognized. This fact is depicted on the screen as white or gray color
                respectively.
                The arcs from a Condition to Properties are "State Generators". They identify the group of
                Properties the states of which are expected to change when the Condition gets satisfied. These
                arcs generate the state they are marked with. The states generated by the arcs are offered to the
                arcs' output Properties to take.
                The structure composed of a Condition, all its output state generating arcs and all
                the arc's output Properties form a property state dependency rule that checks the
                condition and generates the conclusion. This model fragment thus stands for the
                dependency rule's "If" and "Then" parts.
                As each Property may have many state-generating input arcs that are connected to different
                Conditions and hence can produce different offers of state for the Property to take, the "Rule of
                Concordance" is applied. It sounds as follows:
                (1) If none of the Property's input Conditions is satisfied, the Property state does not change.
                (2) If all but one of the Property's input Conditions are not satisfied, the state generated by the
                Property's input arc connected to the satisfied Condition is taken.
                (3) If some of the Property's input Conditions are not satisfied while more than one of the other
                Conditions appear to be satisfied and their output arcs produce the same offer (same state to
                take), the offer is considered to be accepted and the Property takes the offered state.
                (4) If some of the Property's input Conditions are not satisfied while more than one of the other
                Conditions appear to be satisfied and their output arcs produce different offers (different states to
                take), the offers are considered to be competitive and neutralized. So the Property state does not
                change. The multiple offered states, thus, are exclusive in the McLN.
