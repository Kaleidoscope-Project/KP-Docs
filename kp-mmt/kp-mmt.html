                    Reproducing, or, in the other words, simulation modeling of behavior of  dynamical
                    systems is a process of recreating, in a model, changes of states of properties
                    of the modeled system, happening over time.  Therefore, organization of the
                    process of reproducing behavior of these systems presumes creation of models capable
                    of generating sequences of changes of state of variables of the models similar to
                    the sequences of changes of state of properties observed in the modeled systems.

                    So, since, by definition of the dynamical systems, all the changes in their state
                    are explained by the changes in the state of the systems happened earlier, the
                    process of reproducing behavior of a particular <em>qualitative dynamical system</em>
                    carried out with the help of its simulation model should be performed as the sequence of
                    transformations of current state of the model into its next state. In practice,
                    this process, thus, should begin with transformation of the initial state of the
                    model, performed at the initial moment of simulation t=0, into its state observed
                    at the next moment in time, that can be denoted as t=1. Then the state at the time
                    t=1 should be transformed into the next state observed at the next moment t=2. And
                    then the process should continue as a systematic repetition of steps of transformations
                    at the moments t=2, 3, 4, 5, etc., as long as this makes practical sense.

                    Suggested description creates understanding of role of a model in the technique of
                    simulation modeling of behavior of qualitative systems. But it says nothing about how
                    the models of the systems of these kind should be defined and how they should perform
                    transformations of current states of the models into their next states. Meanwhile,
                    qualitative dynamical systems are the instances of the class of dynamical systems whose
                    changes of states are determined by the dependence relations of states of properties of
                    the systems on the combinations of states of groups of properties characterizing situations.
                    Therefore, any particular model of a qualitative system should:
                </p>

                <p>
                    (1) be defined as a collection of n variables, referred to as x<sub>i</sub>, where
                    index i of variable x runs from 0 to n-1; variables represent qualitative properties of the modeled system;
                    and values of the variables are taken from a mathematical set, characteristics of elements
                    of which make it possible to use them for representing states of qualitative properties;
                    while
                </p>

                <p>
                    (2) the mechanism of computation of the states of the variables of the model has to
                    be defined as the system of n equations, written as: x<sub>i</sub><sup>t+1</sup> =
                    <b>f</b>(args<sup>t</sup>), where: x<sub>i</sub><sup>t+1</sup> is the state of the
                    variable x<sub>i</sub> at the time t+1; args<sup>t</sup> stands for the list of
                    arguments of the function <b>f</b>, holding values of groups of variables of the
                    model at time t; and <b>f</b> is the function computing value of variable
                    x<sub>i</sub><sup>t+1</sup>, as the dependent element of the dependence relation
                    corresponding to values of independent variables of the relation, passed to
                    the function as its arguments.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, the modeling technique, intended to enable creation of simulation models of qualitative systems,
                    has been developed as a complex of modeling solutions. Those solution are
                    based on the general principles of mathematical modeling of dynamical systems, on the
                    one hand, and reflect discrete nature of qualitative properties, and the
                    character of behavior of qualitative systems, on the other hand. Theis solutions provide:
                </p>

                <p>
                    (a) definition of domain set, elements of which can be used for representing qualitative
                    values of variables of models;
                </p>

                <p>
                    (b) definition of Qualitative Model Behavior Specification describing all
                    changes in the state of each variable occurring in the response to all situations
                    causing that changes;
                </p>

                    (c) definition of content of computation procedure of state functions of
                    variables of models of qualitative systems, that makes it possible to compute
                    values of state variables of the models;

                        Definition of Domain Set of Mathematical<br>Models of Qualitative Systems
                    </p>

                <p>
                    Creation of mathematical models of dynamical systems in the form of
                    collections of variables assumes having mathematical sets, nature of elements of which
                    makes it possible to use them as the values of variables, denoting  states
                    of properties of the modeled systems. Thus, for example, technique of creating models
                    of <em>quantitative systems</em>, utilizes sets of integer, real or complex numbers,
                    elements of which are used to denote magnitude of modeled properties.
                    On the other hand, technique of modeling either logical or discrete systems,
                    propositions of which may take only two states, use sets consisting of only
                    two elements, such as "yes" and "no", or "1" and "0", depending on
                    adopted interpretation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In contrast, the <em>qualitative systems</em> are neither quantitative nor logical.
                    By assigning to properties of these systems different qualitative assessments of
                    their states, we assume that properties are multivalued and may take different
                    qualitative states at different times. And, thus, the elements
                    of the set which should be used as values of variables, representing qualitative states of
                    properties, will serve as unique markers of different qualities of the properties.
                    Respectively, the markers are not supposed to have any associated with
                    them connotations and interpretations. And, hence, the only relation that can be defined on
                    such a set should be the equivalence relation of each element of the set to itself, and its
                    non-equivalence relation with all other elements of the set.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Such a set can certainly be a set of signs. These signs can be
                    either the letters of alphabet of a language, used for description of the model in the
                    form of text, or the codes of different colors, used
                    when the model and the states of its variables are depicted graphically.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, the definition of the set of signs, used on this page, is the following:

                    Whatever the modeled qualitative system may be - whether existing in
                    reality, or (when is designed) present only in our imagination,
                    creating its model, assumes having detailed specification of
                    dependence of states of each variable of the model on the states of
                    various groups of variables characterizing situations that can arise
                    in the model. And since such models are created for reproducing behavior
                    of the modeled systems, the structure and the content of the specification
                    of the model has to be based on observed, or assumed, dependence of states
                    of each property of the system on the occurrence of situations. This dependence is described

                    Described in this section Qualitative Model Behavior Specification (QMBSpec)
                    follows structure of the QSBSpec, in the sense that it is also defined as a list of the
                    sub-specifications. However, in this case, those
                    sub-specifications are not specs of dependence of individual
                    properties, but the ones of dependence of individual variables. Meanwhile, unlike the QSBSpec (each element of which
                    describes single Correspondence of proposed state of property to expected
                    situation) -  each element of the QMBSpec is defined as the pair: [name of the
                    variable / list of all Correspondences]. In this structure the Correspondences determine
                    dependence of all states of the variable of the pair on all expected situations.

                    Thus, in order to describe content of the QMBSpec, elements of its list  are
                    named: State Variable Dependence Specification (SVDSpec), variables in each
                    SVDSpecs are named x<sub>i</sub>, and values of the variables are denoted by constants
                    taken from the set <b>D</b>. General form of structure of the QMBSpec is presented

                    Definition of State Functions of Variables of Models of Qualitative Systems
                </p>

                <p>
                    To define a function, in a general sense, means to suggest a way for computing
                    its values for all possible combinations of values of its arguments. Respectively,
                    in order to define state function of a variable of a model of qualitative
                    system (intended for reproducing changes of state of a property observed
                    in a modeled system), it is necessary to define a computation procedure of
                    the function, capable of producing values of the variable for all possible
                    combinations of values of groups of variables of the model, characterizing
                    situations which are described in the Correspondences of the SVDSpec of the
                    variable being computed and ought to be passed to the function as its arguments.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, in order to construct a computation procedure of state function of variable,
                    it is necessary to take
                    into account that the suggested way for its computing must ensure obtaining
                    results despite the challenges caused by the characteristics of dependence
                    of states of variables of models of the qualitative systems on irregularities
                    of the occurrence of situations in those systems.
                </p>

                <p class="second-level-section-header">
                    Content of Computation Procedure of State Functions of Variables
                </p>

                <p>
                    Being, by their nature, the systems of simultaneously acting components which
                    produce asynchronous and fragmentary changes in the state of properties of
                    the systems, both the qualitative systems and their behavior are characterized
                    by the fact that, the all transformations of state of properties of the system
                    into their next state, performed at any particular moment in time, are really
                    caused by not all, but only the part of all the variety of situations that can
                    emerge and be present in a system.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This statement actually means that since concrete content of situations can
                    be formed in the model only immediately before computing each of its functions,
                    and thus that the knowledge on which of the situations, expected by the function,
                    must be passed to it as arguments and which are not, cannot be obtained until
                    its computation begins, absolutely all groups of variables listed in the
                    SVDSpec, must be included in the list of arguments of state function of each
                    variable; so to say just in case. And, thus, because of that, it turns out that, not
                    all, but only those groups of arguments, that at the moment of computation of
                    the functions,  characterize expected situations, can be used for computing
                    values of functions (and their variables) corresponding to the expected
                    situations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hence, taking into account all that has been said by now, in order to compute the
                    function, its procedure, (that can be also referred as algorithm) have to be enabled
                    for a) systematic scanning the list of all groups of arguments of the function for
                    identifying among them expected situations, b) producing either the real
                    proposed values of the variable taken from the Correspondences of
                    the Specification in cases when either a single, or few expected situation
                    are detected in the arguments, or, alternatively, producing proposed values
                    marked with some auxiliary symbol that is used to denote produced proposed
                    value as undefined; and b) generate final proposed value of the function
                    out of all proposed values, either obtained as corresponding to all existing
                    or not existing situations by analysing their values with the intention to
                    distinguish three possible outcomes identified as cases occurring when:
                </p>

                <p>
                    (1) none of the situations, described in the SVDSpec of the variable, is
                    present in the state of the model, and, therefore, in order to avoid corruption
                    of the state of variable, the final proposed value of the function should
                    be marked with some auxiliary symbol indicating that this value is undefined; or when
                </p>

                <p>
                    (2) there are found one or more situations proposed values of which require
                    the variable to transition to the same state which means that any of these
                    proposed values may be assigned to final proposed value of the function;
                    or when
                </p>

                <p>
                    (3) two or more simultaneously existing situations produce different states
                    which has to be assigned to the computed variable at once, and thus, in order
                    to avoid collision among the proposed state of the computed variable occurring
                    in that case, the final proposed state of the variable should, similar to
                    the case 1, be marked with some other auxiliary symbol, that also does not
                    belong to the set <b>D</b>, indicating conflict of the proposed values.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So,  only case 2 produces valid final proposed value and later assigns
                    it to the computed variable, but the final proposed value produced
                    in cases 1 and 3 are invalid. They indicate that next
                    value of the function is undefined and therefore the current value of the
                    variable should remain unchanged. However,  a solution, suitable to the cases
                    1 and 3, which makes any undefined final proposed value of the function to be
                    always defined exists. This solution suggests the function has to always
                    produce the current value of the variable, instead of the final proposed
                    value of the function when the computed final proposed value  is undefined.
                    With this approach, the computed variable, that is already in its current state,
                    gets the same current value again, and, thus, leaves the value of the variable
                    effectively unchanged.

                    Proposal of Implementation of State Functions of Variables in the Form of Algebraic Expressions

                <p>
                    If a model of a qualitative system were created as a computer program, then each
                    of its functions, based on the understanding of its content described above, would
                    most likely be implemented in the form of a loop through all groups of its arguments
                    that possibly represent situations expected by the function, and each iteration of
                    the loop could begin with a test whether the group of arguments, being processed
                    in the current iteration, characterizes expected situation, and then compute the
                    value of the function by performing various checks that would choose different
                    computational operations depending on whether the processed situation is present
                    in the state of the model or not. This general description of the content of a
                    computation procedure of a function is exactly that process which the algebraic
                    expression, implementing the function, needs to perform.

                    So, taking into account sequential character of data flow, inherent in the algebraic
                    expressions, and making the attempt to imagine how to fit into the linear computational
                    process of algebraic expression all such elements of algorithms as cycles, computations
                    of runtime estimates of state of data and conditional choices for execution of some
                    operations and bypassing the others, we have nothing left, but to consider two
                    fundamental for developing modeling technique, intended to implement functions in the
                    form of algebraic expression, assumptions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first of these assumptions is that the structure of the expressions, implementing
                    procedures of computation of qualitative functions, should be defined in a way similar
                    to the one of defining structure of discrete functions of Boolean algebra. Or, to be
                    more precise, as a kind of special version of polynomial representation that can be
                    defined as the extension of the well known Disjunctive Normal Form. This form of the
                    algebraic expression will be further referred to as the Extended Disjunctive Normal
                    Form, or XDNF, which specifies the process of computation of expression as the
                    composition of terms. The terms in this structure should compute proposed values of
                    the variable corresponding to situations expected by the function and therefore their
                    number must be the same as the number of groups of variables in the arguments of the
                    function whose combinations of values characterize expected situations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And the second assumption, on the other hand, is that, in order to allow the algebraic
                    expression to analyze and control computation process in accordance with the results
                    of the analysis, the structure of the XDNF expressions should include operations
                    capable of processing two kinds of the data, t.e., main data being computed and the
                    auxiliary data representing results of analysis and undefined results of computation.
                    And from this it follows that the data flow from the arguments of the expression,
                    through the sequence of its all operations to the result should consist not only of
                    the source, intermediate and final main data. It also should include markers presenting
                    results of the analysis and markers explaining "that", or "why", the result of the
                    computation of the expression is undefined.

                    Detailing the process of computation of XDNF expressions more deeply, and trying
                    to reveal the content of the operations necessary for computing the function,
                    one should also assume that the operations included in the expressions should act

                    So, accordingly, the task of the terms of the expression should consist in computing
                    proposed values of the target variable of the function as corresponding
                    to the expected situations described in the specification of dependence of states
                    of variables of the model. Therefore, the technique of computing the terms should
                    include: a) operations which ensure detection of whether the situation, expected
                    by the term, turned out present in the state of the model and b) operations producing
                    proposed value of the variable which (depending on whether the expected situation is
                    present or absent in the model at the time of computation of the expression) may
                    turn out to be either defined or undefined.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And the task of composition of the proposed values, computed by the terms, should be to
                    compute the final proposed value of the function (and its target variable). And,
                    since any variable may take only a single value, the composition step of the computation
                    should be implemented as choosing (from all the produced proposed values of the variable)
                    only a single final proposed value, that should become the value of the function.
                    Hence, the operation, computing this value, should  systematically analyze which
                    of the proposed values are defined and which are not. And it also should test if
                    the proposed values, computed for different terms, have produced different and
                    therefore contradicting each other proposed values. Having, then, these tests
                    accomplished, the operation should mark the final proposed value as undefined in
                    all those cases when either all proposed values happened to be undefined and
                    therefore the final proposed value should also be undefined, or when  two or more

                    That is the computation of these expressions, like any other, must still

                    But the data transmitted along the integrated flow may be both definite and

                    therefore, for compatibility with the elements of <b>D</b>, must also be symbols.

                    Presented example describes dependence of a single variable x0 whose values depend on three Correspondences.
                    The first Correspondence  [K : {(x1 : A), (x2 : B)}] states that variable x0 should take value K,
                    when the values of the variables x1 and x2 hold expected values A and B. The second Correspondence
                    [L : {(x3 : M)}] states that variable x0 should take value L, when the value of variable x3 holds
                    expected values M. And the third Correspondence  [H : {(x4 : E), (x5 : D), (x6 : N)}] states that
                    variable x0 should take value H, when the values of the variables x4, x5 and x6 take expected values
                    E, D and N.

                    Presented example of an equation defined in accordance with above formula describing dependence of
                    values of a variable "x0" on the combinations of values of variables x1, x2 and x3 which
                    characterize two situations (x1), and (x2, x3) that may arise in a particular system, is
                    presented as equation.

                </p>

                <p>
                    This simple equation states that the two values which variable x0 can take are determined by
                    two situations and hence two correspondences. The first (left to right) Correspondences
                    describes that variable x0 should take value P when value of variable x1 is E, whereas the
                    second Correspondence  describes that variable x0 should take value H when value of variable
                    x2 is M, while the value  of variable x3 is simultaneously marked by symbol Q. In spite of
                    such simple dependence, different combinations of values of independent variables (arguments)
                    of the expression: x1, x2 and x3 may cause the expression can be computed with different
                    results and thus would create at least three different values of the variable x0. All these
                    cases are considered and illustrated in the next section, which describes every single step of
                    the computation of the expression in all the details.

                    Computation of the State Variable of the Equation

                <p>
                    Proposed in previous sections, solutions for modeling qualitative dependencies, based on the
                    hybrid set <b>S</b>, make it possible to describe dependence of changes of values of a qualitative
                    variable on various emerging and disappearing situations. An example, presented in (1),
                    represents such dependence in the form of algebraic equation, utilizes elements of the set
                    <b>S</b> for denoting values of variables, and computes the algebraic expression, located in the
                    right part of the equation, as the composition of operations defined on the set S. Now,
                    the content of this section is intended to illustrate application of the elements and the
                    operations of the set <b>S</b> in the process of computation of the expression of the equation (1).
                    The content of the proposed example is presented in Figure 4 which has four sections: a, b,
                    c and d.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All four sections of the example illustrate the process of computation of a certain value
                    of the dependent variable x0, of the same equation (1), depending on a particular combination
                    of values of the variables: x1, x2 and x3, which are the arguments of the expression
                    being computed. Therefore, in order to show how the expression obtains different results,
                    each of the four sections begins with the initialization of the computed value x0 with
                    always the same value G, but with each time different values of the variables:
                    x1, x2 and x3.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Six lines, in each section, following the line of initialization, depict the results of
                    successive application of five operations: ?, &, *, | and <, causing the change in the
                    state of the process of computation of the expression. These changes are expressed in
                    the diagram as a replacement in each following line, presenting the result of the operation,
                    of that part of the line which holds the construct: "operand-operation-operand" representing
                    executed operation by the value produced by this operation. The arrows located between the
                    lines in section "a", directed vertically downwards from the sign of the operation to the
                    symbol depicting the result of the application of the operation, serve for drawing attention
                    to the operation performed. They are used at each of the computation steps in section "a" only,
                    but not placed in the remaining three sections since all these sections depict the same
                    execution process while the difference in the content of computation is determined by different
                    values assigned to the arguments of the expression at time of their initialization. Here
                    below is Figure 4a followed by the detailed description of steps of execution of the operations.

                <p>
                    Figure 4a provides a detailed description of the steps of computation of the expression.
                    It illustrates the case when the arguments of the expression are initialized as x0 = G;
                    x1 = L; x2 = M; x3 = Q; and thus the situation (x1) is not present and is not recognized,
                    but the situation (x2, x3) is present and recognized. Therefore, the produced proposed
                    value "H" of the variable x0 is computed as the correspondence to the situation (x2, x3).
                    So, the operations Disjunction and Application choose and accept it as the valid value of
                    the variable x0. Further description of the process of computation of values of the variable
                    x0 of this case proceeds as the detailed description of five steps of execution of five
                    operations ?, &, *, |, < constituting the expression.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Step 1 is performed as the execution of the Equivalence (?) operation which is applied to
                    the situation (x1), presented as a group of variables consisting of only one variable x1,
                    and to the situation (x2, x3), presented as a group consisting of two variables x2 and x3.
                    So, as it follows from the structure of the expression, the task of this operation is to
                    test if the current value of each variable is the same as its expected one.  In Figure 4a,
                    the application of this operation is depicted as three arrows directed vertically from the
                    sign of the Equivalence operation "?" to the symbol yielded as the result depending on the
                    operands of the operation. Thus, as the value of the variable x1 is "L" and its expected
                    value is "E" the application of the Equivalence operation to these operands yields the
                    symbol of "$" - indicating that the value "L" of operand x1 and constant "E" are not the same.
                    Yet, at the same time, the value "M" of variable x2 is the same as the constant "M" and
                    the value "Q" of the variable x3 is the same as the constant "N". Hence, application of
                    the Equivalence operation to both pairs of the second situation yields the auxiliary symbol "!".
                </p>

                <p>
                    Step 2 is performed by the Conjunction (&) operation. The task of this operation is to compute
                    the conjunction of all results of the Equivalence operation and thus show that all the
                    current values of the independent variables characterizing the situation have been compared with
                    the expected ones and therefore the expected situation is present in the state of the model
                    and thus is considered as recognized. So, this operation is used to conduct the test for the
                    results of the Equivalence operations yielded for each situation. So, to confirm the recognition,
                    the operands of the Conjunction operation may be different combinations of symbols "!" and "$"
                    therefore the role of the operation is, in respect to the values of operands, is absolutely the
                    same as the behavior of the well known boolean Conjunction operating with the values named "true"
                    and "false". The application of this operation, in the considered case, is depicted as one arrow
                    directed from the sign "&" of this operation to the symbol yielded as its result; in this case it
                    is symbol "!".
                </p>

                <p>
                    Step 3 is performed by the Product (*) operation. The output of this operation is a proposed
                    value that is produced as the correspondence to recognized or not recognized situation. Depending
                    on the result of the recognition of situation performed by the Equivalence and Conjunction
                    operations, the proposed value produced by the Production operation may be presented as either
                    the constant corresponding to the recognized situation described in the Correspondence sub-expression
                    and located as the operand of the Production operand placed on the left side of the operation,
                    or as the symbol "$" already used to indicate the fact that the situation was not recognized.
                    On the Figure 4a, application of the Production operation is depicted as one arrow directed from
                    the sign "*" to the domain symbol "H" yielded as result of the application of the operation to
                    its operands, given as symbols of "H" and "!".
                </p>

                <p>
                    Step 4 is performed by the Disjunction (|) operation. The execution of this step begins when
                    all proposed values of a variable are already determined by the three previous steps,
                    and consists in choosing the final proposed value out of all produced proposed values. So, to
                    accomplish that choice the Disjunction operation analyzes all the proposed values one by one
                    and selects from them the only final value of the computation process that serves as a candidate
                    to become the next value of the variable. Therefore, as it is defined by the mechanism of this
                    operation, its result can be yielded as either a) an auxiliary symbol "$", indicating the fact
                    that none of the expected situations is recognized, b) an element of the set <b>D</b>, when one or more
                    situations are recognized and all produced as the correspondence to recognized situations proposed
                    values are represented by the same element of the set <b>D</b>, or c) an auxiliary symbol "#", indicating
                    the fact that two or more of the recognized situations produced proposed values represented by the
                    different elements of the set <b>D</b>, and thus created the conflict in choosing the single final value
                    of computation. In Figure 4a the Disjunction operation takes operands given as symbols "$" and "H"
                    and therefore chooses of them as the final proposed values symbol "H";
                </p>

                <p>
                    Step 5 is performed by the Application (<) operation. This operation is the guard of the computed
                    value of the variable of the equation. It takes two operands: the current value of the variable
                    and the final proposed value - produced by the Disjunction operation, which can be either the
                    element of the set <b>D</b> or the one of the symbols of the set <b>X</b>. Following its role of guarding, this
                    operation is to prevent any symbol, other than those that represent the valid next value of the
                    variable, from becoming the result of the computation of the expression. So, the operation checks
                    if the final proposed value, given to it as the operand is a symbol of set <b>D</b> and if it is then
                    yields the  final proposed value, or otherwise (when the final proposed value is a symbol belonging
                    to set <b>X</b> indicating that the next value of the variable is not computed) yields the first operand
                    representing the variable's current value, that leads to the value of the variable in fact will be
                    left unmodified. In the Figure 4a the yielded by the Disjunction operation result is represented
                    by symbols "H", therefore next computed value of the variable is computed as the symbol "H"
                </p>

                <p>
                    Execution of step 5 completes the description of computation of the expression, presented in Figure 4a.

                    The computation of the rest of the sections of b), c), and d) of Figure 4 follows the same

                    order of the application of the operations, to compute the expression differently. That is, in
                    fact, based on the internal analysis, conducted by the operations that make them to produce
                    different values of the variables corresponding to different situations presented by arguments of

                    Figure 4b illustrates case when arguments of the expression are set as  x0 = G; x1 = E; x2 = M;
                    x3 = Q; This makes both: the situation (x1) and the situation (x2, x3) are recognized, and,
                    as the consequence of that, the produced proposed values "P" and "H" create uncertainty in
                    choosing the final value of the variable x0 accomplished by the Disjunction operation that in
                    that case marks the final proposed values by symbol "#" to indicate that the final value is not
                    determined. Hence, the Application operation should leave the current value "G" of the variable
                    x0 unchanged.

                    Figure 4c illustrates case opposite to the case 1a. Here the arguments of the expression
                    are set as  x0 = G; x1 = E; x2 = U; x3 = Q; and this leads to the situation (x1) is recognized,
                    but the situation (x2, x3) is not recognized. Hence, the only produced proposed values "P" of
                    the variable x0 which belongs to the domain set <b>D</b> is computed as the correspondence to the
                    only existing situation (x1).

                    Figure 4d illustrates case opposite to the case 1b. In this case the arguments of the expression
                    are set as  x0 = G; x1 = R; x2 = M; x3 = Z; This makes that none of the expected situations is
                    present and, hence, none of the expected situations is recognized. And so, as a consequence of
                    that, both proposed values of the variable are marked with the symbol "$". And therefore, similar
                    to the case 1b, the Application operation leaves the value of the variable x0 in its current
                    value "G".

                    And as it often happens, obtaining an answer to one question may immediately pave the road
                    to the emergence of the next one, a more general question. So, obtaining the answers to two
                    questions, asked at the beginning of this page, immediately sparks interest in getting the
                    answer to the new question: How should the models of the qualitative systems be organized.
                    All the remaining pages of the description of the project are devoted to answering this question.
                    And the description of this starts right on the next page providing the more formal definition
                    to described on this page set <b>S</b> and its five operations as the algebra, named "The Algebra of
                    Symbols" and continues as presentations of other modeling solution proposing representation of
                    the system of qualitative equations of the model based on the Vector State Space approach and
                    the Graph Based Multicolored Logical Net (McLN) modeling formalism, creation of which is
                    supported by the application named Qualitative Systems Modeling and Simulating Environment.

                The Page, titled: "Multicolored Logical Net Graphical Modeling Formalism", or McLN MF,
                is the means enabling development of the qualitative systems simulation models in
                the form of graphically depicted net. Elements of this net represent properties of
                the modeled system, whereas the simulation process reproduces changes of the states
                of the properties as changes of the colors of the depicted elements.

                This section proposes a way of describing behavior of a particular qualitative

                of the system on the state of a group of properties occurrence of which causes
                transition of the  dependent property from its current to the next state, that is
                deemed the "proposed state of the property", provided by the rule.

                Objective of this page is to introduce notion of class of Qualitative Dynamical Systems
                and to describe characteristics of the nature and behavior of Qualitative Dynamical Systems,
                constituting foundation for creation of mathematical models of these systems. The page
                identifies atomic element of behavior of the systems and describes basic ways of composition
                of these elements letting the models of the system to be capable of reproducing various
                forms of behavior, observed in the qualitative dynamical systems.
