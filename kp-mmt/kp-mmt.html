                        To reproduce behavior of dynamical systems, or, in the other words
                        to conduct simulation modeling of behavior of these systems, is a process of recreation
                        of changes observed in the state of modeled systems with the help of the simulation
                        models of these systems. And, since by definition of behavior of dynamical
                        systems, all changes of their state are explained by the changes in the state
                        of the systems happened earlier, organization of process of reproducing behavior
                        of the systems presumes creating such models that could be used
                        by the simulation process for generating the same sequences of transitions of states
                        of models from their current state to the next one, as those observed in the modeled
                        systems.

                        Thus, the process of reproducing behavior of a particular qualitative dynamical system
                        with the help
                        of its simulation model could be performed as the sequence of steps that begin with
                        transformation of the initial state of the model, performed at the initial moment of
                        simulation t=0, into its state observed at the next moment in time, that can be denoted
                        as t=1; then the state at the time t=1 should be transformed into the next state
                        observed at the next moment t=2; and then the process should continue as a systematic
                        repetition of steps of transformations at the moments t=2, 3, 4, 5, etc., as long as this

                    <p>
                        In contrast, the <em>qualitative systems</em> are neither quantitative nor logical.
                        By assigning to properties of these systems different qualitative assessments of
                        their states, we assume that properties are multivalued and may take different
                        qualitative states at different times. And, thus, the elements
                        of the set which should be used as values of variables, representing qualitative states of
                        properties, will serve as unique markers of different qualities of the properties.
                        Respectively, the markers are not supposed to have any associated with
                        them connotations and interpretations. And, hence, the only relation that can be defined on
                        such a set should be the equivalence relation of each element of the set to itself, and its
                        non-equivalence relation with all other elements of the set.

                    <p>
                        Such a set can certainly be a set of signs. These signs can be
                        either the letters of alphabet of a language, used for description of the model in the
                        form of text, or the codes of different colors, used
                        when the model and the states of its variables are depicted graphically.

                    <p>
                        So, the definition of the set of signs, used on this page, is the following:

                                Mathematical Set of the models of qualitative systems is the collection
                                of uninterpreted uppercase letters of Latin alphabet, and, thus, is defined as:
                                <b>D</b> = {A, B, C, ..., Z}. Being a collection elements which are used
                                for representing values of arguments of function and values of variables computed
                                by the functions, set <b>D</b> serves in the models as the domain and
                                the range of the state functions of variables of the models.

                        sub-specifications are not specs of dependence of individual
                        properties, but the ones of dependence of individual variables. Meanwhile, unlike the QSBSpec (each element of which
                        describes single Correspondence of proposed state of property to expected
                        situation) -  each element of the QMBSpec is defined as the pair: [name of the
                        variable / list of all Correspondences]. In this structure the Correspondences determine
                        dependence of all states of the variable of the pair on all expected situations.

                        However, in order to construct a computation procedure of state function of variable,
                        it is necessary to take
                        into account that the suggested way for its computing must ensure obtaining
                        results despite the challenges caused by the characteristics of dependence
                        of states of variables of models of the qualitative systems on irregularities
                        of the occurrence of situations in those systems.

                    <p>
                        Being, by their nature, the systems of simultaneously acting components which
                        produce asynchronous and fragmentary changes in the state of properties of
                        the systems, both the qualitative systems and their behavior are characterized
                        by the fact that, the all transformations of state of properties of the system
                        into their next state, performed at any particular moment in time, are really
                        caused by not all, but only the part of all the variety of situations that can
                        emerge and be present in a system.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This statement actually means that since concrete content of situations can
                        be formed in the model only immediately before computing each of its functions,
                        and thus that the knowledge on which of the situations, expected by the function,
                        must be passed to it as arguments and which are not, cannot be obtained until
                        its computation begins, absolutely all groups of variables listed in the
                        SVDSpec, must be included in the list of arguments of state function of each
                        variable; so to say just in case. And, thus, because of that, it turns out that, not
                        all, but only those groups of arguments, that at the moment of computation of
                        the functions,  characterize expected situations, can be used for computing
                        values of functions (and their variables) corresponding to the expected
                        situations.

                    <p>
                        Hence, taking into account all that has been said by now, in order to compute the
                        function, its procedure, (that can be also referred as algorithm) have to be enabled
                        for a) systematic scanning the list of all groups of arguments of the function for
                        identifying among them expected situations, b) producing either the real
                        proposed values of the variable taken from the Correspondences of
                        the Specification in cases when either a single, or few expected situation
                        are detected in the arguments, or, alternatively, producing proposed values
                        marked with some auxiliary symbol that is used to denote produced proposed
                        value as undefined; and b) generate final proposed value of the function
                        out of all proposed values, either obtained as corresponding to all existing
                        or not existing situations by analysing their values with the intention to
                        distinguish three possible outcomes identified as cases occurring when:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        (1) none of the situations, described in the SVDSpec of the variable, is
                        present in the state of the model, and, therefore, in order to avoid corruption
                        of the state of variable, the final proposed value of the function should
                        be marked with some auxiliary symbol indicating that this value is undefined; or when
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        (2) there are found one or more situations proposed values of which require
                        the variable to transition to the same state which means that any of these
                        proposed values may be assigned to final proposed value of the function;
                        or when
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        (3) two or more simultaneously existing situations produce different states
                        which has to be assigned to the computed variable at once, and thus, in order
                        to avoid collision among the proposed state of the computed variable occurring
                        in that case, the final proposed state of the variable should, similar to
                        the case 1, be marked with some other auxiliary symbol, that also does not
                        belong to the set <b>D</b>, indicating conflict of the proposed values.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So,  only case 2 produces valid final proposed value and later assigns
                        it to the computed variable, but the final proposed value produced
                        in cases 1 and 3 are invalid. They indicate that next
                        value of the function is undefined and therefore the current value of the
                        variable should remain unchanged. However,  a solution, suitable to the cases
                        1 and 3, which makes any undefined final proposed value of the function to be
                        always defined exists. This solution suggests the function has to always
                        produce the current value of the variable, instead of the final proposed
                        value of the function when the computed final proposed value  is undefined.
                        With this approach, the computed variable, that is already in its current state,
                        gets the same current value again, and, thus, leaves the value of the variable
                        effectively unchanged.

<!--                    </p>-->

                    <p>
                        As it is shown in the Figure 2, the algorithm takes four arguments. Its first
                        argument is a list of groups of variables of the model, passed into the function
                        at the moment of its computation. The second and third arguments are taken
                        directly from the Correspondences of the specification. They are passed to
                        the function as a list of groups of constant, describing expected situations
                        which may be formed as combinations of values of groups of variables passed
                        to the function as its first argument; and as a list of constants denoting
                        proposed values corresponding to the expected situations. The fourth argument
                        is the current value of the variable being computed. It is used as the spare value
                        of the function in case when its computed value turns out to be undefined.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This algorithm organizes the evaluation of a function in the form of a cycle
                        through all groups of the first argument of the function, performed with the
                        purpose: 1) to identify all situations expected by the function that may be
                        present, at the time of evaluation of the function, in the list of groups
                        of its first argument; 2) to determine the proposed value of the variable
                        for each group of variables as corresponding to the identified situation or
                        to mark it as undefined using the auxiliary symbol $ for this purpose; 3)
                        to analyze the state of each proposed value, which may turn out to be either
                        defined or not, and to determine the final proposed value of the function,
                        which thus may also turn out to be undefined due to the fact that either
                        none of the expected in the list of groups of the first argument situations
                        was detected, or two or more expected situations were detected, but it
                        turned out that their proposed values are different and therefore, during
                        the analysis, the final proposed value was marked with the symbol #.

<!--                        and 4)-->
<!--                        to use, after completion of the cycle, as the computed value of the function-->
<!--                        the final proposed value, computed in the cycle, if it holds a symbol that-->
<!--                        belongs to set D, or to use the current state of the variable, passed to the-->
<!--                        function as its fourth argument when the final proposed value is undefined.-->
                    </p>

                    <p>

                        it is the first attempt at a formal description of the procedure for calculating
                        the state function of the model variables. This makes it possible to evaluate its

                        not only by means of checking many conditions and changing the order of execution
                        of operations. Very often when creating algorithms that use
                        sub-algorithms, we place all the logic of data analysis in those sub-algorithms,
                        leaving to the main algorithm only the task of controlling invocations of the
                        sub-algorithms in the computation process.

                    <p>
                        So what should be practically done to turn the vision of such an imaginary algorithm
                        into an existing reality? The answer to this question is actually quite simple.
                        And it is based on the following obvious chain of observations (1), (2), and (3).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        (1) Since both local variables: "proposed state of variable" and "final
                        proposed state of variable", used in the algorithm, are qualitative and hence,
                        according to the definition made above, elements of the set <b>D</b> must be used
                        to represent their computed values, and also since in order to represent
                        different undefined values of both variables must be used different special
                        signs, then for compatibility by type, all special signs must be compatible
                        with the elements of the set <b>D</b>, and therefore the entire variety of auxiliary
                        signs should be defined as a set of auxiliary symbols <b>X</b> = { #, $, ! }.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        (2) Emerging as a result of observation (1), homogeneity of elements of the
                        set <b>D</b> with elements of the set <b>X</b>, existing due to the necessity to use
                        both: elements of the set <b>D</b> and elements of the set <b>X</b> as values of the
                        qualitative variables of the algorithm, creates unique opportunity to
                        consider idea of defining  unified carrier set <b>S</b> of the model as the union
                        of the set of values of variables <b>D</b> and the set of auxiliary symbols <b>X</b>, on
                        the one hand; and to define on the set a family of hybrid operations capable
                        of taking operands and producing the result of applying the operation to
                        operands that can be elements of the set <b>S</b>, on the other hand.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        (3) If when striving to define a procedure for computation of a function
                        in the form of an algebraic expression, we, for achieving this goal, would
                        make a decision to follow the idea of moving all state testing operations
                        of the computation process and its data to a lower level of the hierarchy
                        of algorithm, i.e. on the level of data processing operations used in the
                        process of computing  algebraic expressions, then this would mean that, in
                        accordance with the emerging homogeneity of the elements of the set <b>D</b> with the
                        elements of the sets <b>X</b> described in observation (2) would be that practical
                        solution that makes it possible to use he set <b>S</b> and the operations for
                        implementing the functions computation algorithm in the form of algebraic
                        expressions implemented as a composition of operations defined on the set <b>S</b>.

                        <b>Equivalence</b> (?) operation is the first that begins computation of the procedure of a function.
                        It is used to recognize situations, description of which is passed to a function as the groups of
                        its arguments. When recognizing a particular situation, this operation compares all the values
                        of a group of the arguments, which may or may not contain the description of the expected situation
                        present in the model at the time of computation of the function, with their expected values. To
                        perform this comparison, the operation takes two operands whose values are symbols of the set <b>D</b>
                        and yields either symbol "!", which belongs to the set <b>X</b>, if both operands are represented by
                        the same symbol of set <b>D</b>, or the value "~", which also belongs to the set <b>X</b>, if the operands are
                        represented by different symbols of the set <b>D</b>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Conjunction</b> (&) operation is also used to recognize situations, or more precisely to
                        compute the indicators representing the fact that all the results of comparing the states of
                        properties with their expected values obtained as a result of applying the Equivalence
                        operation have been compared and thus the expected situation is recognized. It is called
                        Conjunction because it inherits its role from the Conjunction operation defined on a set
                        consisting of only two elements and solves the same problem. This operation takes two operands
                        computed by the Equivalence operation by comparing its operands, each of which can be either
                        the "!" symbol or the "~" symbol, and returns the "!" symbol only in case - when  both of its
                        operands contain the "!" symbol, or the "~" symbol for all other combinations of operands.
                        Properties of the commutativity and associativity of the Conjunction operation allow it to be
                        used for computing n-ary conjunction of all results of the Equivalence operation, where the
                        output of n-ary conjunction is the value "!" if and only if all results of the Equivalence
                        operation are represented by the symbol "!", or the symbol "~" otherwise.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Production</b> (*) operation is the generator of the  proposed state of the variable. It has
                        gotten its name because it acts in the same
                        way as the production rule. One of the operands of this operation is the result of recognition
                        of the situation, i.e. it may contain either symbol "!" or "~" obtained after  computation
                        of the n-ary conjunction accomplished by the Conjunction operation. While the second argument
                        is the element of the set D, that is described in the Correspondence of the specification as
                        the proposed value of the variable. The operation produces a proposed value of the variable
                        that is a dependent element of the relation computed by the function in case when the operand,
                        representing the result of recognition of situation "!" indicates that the situation is recognized,
                        or the symbol "~" when the result of recognition is the symbol "~" meaning that the situation is
                        not recognized.

                    <p>
                        <b>Disjunction</b> (|) operation is called Disjunction because in the process of
                        computation of the function it plays a role similar to the role of the Disjunction operation
                        of an algebra defined on a set of two elements. Its task is to look through all the proposed
                        values and do the best to find a single "final proposed value" which should become the value
                        of the function, and thus the next value of the state variable of the model. So, to accomplish
                        the task this operation takes two operands that can be represented by any symbols of the set S.
                        And it is commutative and associative, similar to the Conjunction operation, it is used to
                        compute the n-ary disjunction of all the results of the Production operation. In the process
                        of this computation, it selects from all the proposed values produced by the Production
                        operation a single final proposed value that should become the value  of the function (and the
                        next value of the state variable of a model) if such a value can be found among all the
                        proposed values produced as corresponding to all situations, regardless of whether
                        the situation is recognized or not. There are three possible outcomes of the application of
                        this operation produced as a final proposed value. Based on the following three rules.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        1) It yields symbol "~" when it turns out that none of the expected situations that are
                        independent elements in relation to the dependence of the variable on the situation were
                        recognized since none of them are present in the state of the function arguments;
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        2) It yields a symbol "d" that is an element of the set <b>D</b>, produced by the Production operation,
                        as corresponding to the recognized situations in the case when one or more expected situations
                        turned out to be present in the state of the arguments of a function and all recognized
                        situations (when there are several of them) have produced the same proposed value of the variable.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        3) Or, it yields the symbol "#" denoting the case when at least two of the expected situations
                        are present in the model (and the arguments of a function) and are recognized, but corresponding
                        to the situations proposed values require the computed variable to simultaneously take
                        different values. And since the function, by definition, can compute only one value, it is
                        interpreted by the next operation as the fact that the final proposed value that this operation
                        should produce could not be found among the previously computed proposed values. And.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Application</b> (<) operation is the last one in the procedure of computation of a function.
                        Yet, its role has nothing to do with the continuation of computation of the function. It is used
                        to redefine the function by transforming it from partially defined to defined on all possible
                        combinations of its arguments (whether they represent or not represent situations) and, thus,
                        for eliminating cases when, due to a conflict of values detected by the Disjunction
                        operation, the final value turned out to be undefined; that is, to transform a partially defined
                        function into a complete one. In solving this problem, the Application operation, like all previous
                        operations, also takes two operands. But unlike all previous operations, it is not commutative.
                        Its first operand is the final proposed value (computed or not by the Disjunction operation),
                        and the second is an additional argument of the function containing the current value of the
                        variable, in case the computation of the next value of the variable may not work. Thus, all this
                        operation does is check the type of the final proposed value of the function passed to it as
                        its first operand and determine the computed value of the function using the final proposed value
                        if that value is represented by an element of the set <b>D</b>, i.e., is a real symbol representing
                        the next state of the variable. Or, alternatively, use the value of the additional argument of
                        the function which is the current value of the function which should replace the unevaluated
                        final proposed value.

                        two situations and hence two correspondences. The first (left to right) Correspondences
                        describes that variable x0 should take value P when value of variable x1 is E, whereas the
                        second Correspondence  describes that variable x0 should take value H when value of variable
                        x2 is M, while the value  of variable x3 is simultaneously marked by symbol Q. In spite of
                        such simple dependence, different combinations of values of independent variables (arguments)
                        of the expression: x1, x2 and x3 may cause the expression can be computed with different
                        results and thus would create at least three different values of the variable x0. All these
                        cases are considered and illustrated in the next section, which describes every single step of
                        the computation of the expression in all the details.

                    <p>
                        Proposed in previous sections, solutions for modeling qualitative dependencies, based on the
                        hybrid set S, make it possible to describe dependence of changes of values of a qualitative
                        variable on various emerging and disappearing situations. An example, presented in (1),
                        represents such dependence in the form of algebraic equation, utilizes elements of the set
                        S for denoting values of variables, and computes the algebraic expression, located in the
                        right part of the equation, as the composition of operations defined on the set S. Now,
                        the content of this section is intended to illustrate application of the elements and the
                        operations of the set S in the process of computation of the expression of the equation (1).
                        The content of the proposed example is presented in Figure 4 which has four sections: a, b,
                        c and d.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        All four sections of the example illustrate the process of computation of a certain value
                        of the dependent variable x0, of the same equation (1), depending on a particular combination
                        of values of the variables: x1, x2 and x3, which are the arguments of the expression
                        being computed. Therefore, in order to show how the expression obtains different results,
                        each of the four sections begins with the initialization of the computed value x0 with
                        always the same value G, but with each time different values of the variables:
                        x1, x2 and x3.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Six lines, in each section, following the line of initialization, depict the results of
                        successive application of five operations: ?, &, *, | and <, causing the change in the
                        state of the process of computation of the expression. These changes are expressed in
                        the diagram as a replacement in each following line, presenting the result of the operation,
                        of that part of the line which holds the construct: "operand-operation-operand" representing
                        executed operation by the value produced by this operation. The arrows located between the
                        lines in section "a", directed vertically downwards from the sign of the operation to the
                        symbol depicting the result of the application of the operation, serve for drawing attention
                        to the operation performed. They are used at each of the computation steps in section "a" only,
                        but not placed in the remaining three sections since all these sections depict the same
                        execution process while the difference in the content of computation is determined by different
                        values assigned to the arguments of the expression at time of their initialization. Here
                        below is Figure 4a followed by the detailed description of steps of execution of the operations.

                    <p>
                        Figure 4a provides a detailed description of the steps of computation of the expression.
                        It illustrates the case when the arguments of the expression are initialized as x0 = G;
                        x1 = L; x2 = M; x3 = Q; and thus the situation (x1) is not present and is not recognized,
                        but the situation (x2, x3) is present and recognized. Therefore, the produced proposed
                        value "H" of the variable x0 is computed as the correspondence to the situation (x2, x3).
                        So, the operations Disjunction and Application choose and accept it as the valid value of
                        the variable x0. Further description of the process of computation of values of the variable
                        x0 of this case proceeds as the detailed description of five steps of execution of five
                        operations ?, &, *, |, < constituting the expression.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Step 1 is performed as the execution of the Equivalence (?) operation which is applied to
                        the situation (x1), presented as a group of variables consisting of only one variable x1,
                        and to the situation (x2, x3), presented as a group consisting of two variables x2 and x3.
                        So, as it follows from the structure of the expression, the task of this operation is to
                        test if the current value of each variable is the same as its expected one.  In Figure 4a,
                        the application of this operation is depicted as three arrows directed vertically from the
                        sign of the Equivalence operation "?" to the symbol yielded as the result depending on the
                        operands of the operation. Thus, as the value of the variable x1 is "L" and its expected
                        value is "E" the application of the Equivalence operation to these operands yields the
                        symbol of "$" - indicating that the value "L" of operand x1 and constant "E" are not the same.
                        Yet, at the same time, the value "M" of variable x2 is the same as the constant "M" and
                        the value "Q" of the variable x3 is the same as the constant "N". Hence, application of
                        the Equivalence operation to both pairs of the second situation yields the auxiliary symbol "!".
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Step 2 is performed by the Conjunction (&) operation. The task of this operation is to compute
                        the conjunction of all results of the Equivalence operation and thus show that all the
                        current values of the independent variables characterizing the situation have been compared with
                        the expected ones and therefore the expected situation is present in the state of the model
                        and thus is considered as recognized. So, this operation is used to conduct the test for the
                        results of the Equivalence operations yielded for each situation. So, to confirm the recognition,
                        the operands of the Conjunction operation may be different combinations of symbols "!" and "$"
                        therefore the role of the operation is, in respect to the values of operands, is absolutely the
                        same as the behavior of the well known boolean Conjunction operating with the values named "true"
                        and "false". The application of this operation, in the considered case, is depicted as one arrow
                        directed from the sign "&" of this operation to the symbol yielded as its result; in this case it
                        is symbol "!".
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Step 3 is performed by the Product (*) operation. The output of this operation is a proposed
                        value that is produced as the correspondence to recognized or not recognized situation. Depending
                        on the result of the recognition of situation performed by the Equivalence and Conjunction
                        operations, the proposed value produced by the Production operation may be presented as either
                        the constant corresponding to the recognized situation described in the Correspondence sub-expression
                        and located as the operand of the Production operand placed on the left side of the operation,
                        or as the symbol "$" already used to indicate the fact that the situation was not recognized.
                        On the Figure 4a, application of the Production operation is depicted as one arrow directed from
                        the sign "*" to the domain symbol "H" yielded as result of the application of the operation to
                        its operands, given as symbols of "H" and "!".
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Step 4 is performed by the Disjunction (|) operation. The execution of this step begins when
                        all proposed values of a variable are already determined by the three previous steps,
                        and consists in choosing the final proposed value out of all produced proposed values. So, to
                        accomplish that choice the Disjunction operation analyzes all the proposed values one by one
                        and selects from them the only final value of the computation process that serves as a candidate
                        to become the next value of the variable. Therefore, as it is defined by the mechanism of this
                        operation, its result can be yielded as either a) an auxiliary symbol "$", indicating the fact
                        that none of the expected situations is recognized, b) an element of the set <b>D</b>, when one or more
                        situations are recognized and all produced as the correspondence to recognized situations proposed
                        values are represented by the same element of the set <b>D</b>, or c) an auxiliary symbol "#", indicating
                        the fact that two or more of the recognized situations produced proposed values represented by the
                        different elements of the set <b>D</b>, and thus created the conflict in choosing the single final value
                        of computation. In Figure 4a the Disjunction operation takes operands given as symbols "$" and "H"
                        and therefore chooses of them as the final proposed values symbol "H";
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Step 5 is performed by the Application (<) operation. This operation is the guard of the computed
                        value of the variable of the equation. It takes two operands: the current value of the variable
                        and the final proposed value - produced by the Disjunction operation, which can be either the
                        element of the set <b>D</b> or the one of the symbols of the set <b>X</b>. Following its role of guarding, this
                        operation is to prevent any symbol, other than those that represent the valid next value of the
                        variable, from becoming the result of the computation of the expression. So, the operation checks
                        if the final proposed value, given to it as the operand is a symbol of set <b>D</b> and if it is then
                        yields the  final proposed value, or otherwise (when the final proposed value is a symbol belonging
                        to set <b>X</b> indicating that the next value of the variable is not computed) yields the first operand
                        representing the variable's current value, that leads to the value of the variable in fact will be
                        left unmodified. In the Figure 4a the yielded by the Disjunction operation result is represented
                        by symbols "H", therefore next computed value of the variable is computed as the symbol "H"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Execution of step 5 completes the description of computation of the expression, presented in Figure 4a.

                        The computation of the rest of the sections of b), c), and d) of Figure 4 follows the same
                        schema as the computation of presented in Figure 4a, and is different only in the way of
                        initialization of the variables: x1, x2, x3, that make the expression, in spite of the same
                        order of the application of the operations, to compute the expression differently. That is, in
                        fact, based on the internal analysis, conducted by the operations that make them to produce
                        different values of the variables corresponding to different situations presented by arguments of
                        the expression, initialized differently. These differences in the computation of the rest of the
                        section is described as follows.

                        Figure 4b illustrates case when arguments of the expression are set as  x0 = G; x1 = E; x2 = M;
                        x3 = Q; This makes both: the situation (x1) and the situation (x2, x3) are recognized, and,
                        as the consequence of that, the produced proposed values "P" and "H" create uncertainty in
                        choosing the final value of the variable x0 accomplished by the Disjunction operation that in
                        that case marks the final proposed values by symbol "#" to indicate that the final value is not
                        determined. Hence, the Application operation should leave the current value "G" of the variable
                        x0 unchanged.

                        are set as  x0 = G; x1 = E; x2 = U; x3 = Q; and this leads to the situation (x1) is recognized,
                        but the situation (x2, x3) is not recognized. Hence, the only produced proposed values "P" of
                        the variable x0 which belongs to the domain set D is computed as the correspondence to the
                        only existing situation (x1).

                        Figure 4d illustrates case opposite to the case 1b. In this case the arguments of the expression
                        are set as  x0 = G; x1 = R; x2 = M; x3 = Z; This makes that none of the expected situations is
                        present and, hence, none of the expected situations is recognized. And so, as a consequence of
                        that, both proposed values of the variable are marked with the symbol "$". And therefore, similar
                        to the case 1b, the Application operation leaves the value of the variable x0 in its current
                        value "G".

                Page, titled: "Qualitative Dynamical Systems Multi-colored Logical Net Graphical Modeling
                Formalism", addresses the essence of the questions arising at the time of developing
                mathematical models of Qualitative Dynamical Systems. It sets up requirements for the
                algebraic operations and justifies the necessity of having the algebraic system, operations
                of which could be utilized for defining mathematical models of behavior of qualitative systems.
