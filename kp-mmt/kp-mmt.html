            <p>
                When studying behavior of dynamical systems phenomenologically - that is not by delving into
                their internal machinery, but instead considering only abstract collections of their properties
                changing over time - we, following fundamental principles of mathematical modeling, tend to
                explain causes of changes of states of properties of the systems by existence of certain
                dependence relations of states of properties on the changes of states of the same or some other
                properties; and, optionaly, on the effects of certain external systems or the environment.
            </p>

            <p>
                Accordingly, in order to create a model of a qualitative system, we have  to define a collection
                of variables representing qualitative properties of the modeled system, i.e., qualitative
                variables, which take their values ​​from a set, elements of which can be used to
                represent qualitative states of properties, and define the model in the form of the system
                of n equations written as: x = f(args). In such equations, functions f are called state
                function of the variable x and considered capable of computing transitions of the variables,
                and the model as a whole, from the current to the next state.
            </p>

            <p>
                Therefore, the objective of this page is to describe technique of mathematical modeling of
                behavior of qualitative dynamical systems that is developed in the process of studying of
                feasibility of creating dynamical models of qualitative systems capable of reproducing
                observed changes in the state of qualitative properties of the systems as a process consisting
                of responses of models to combinations of states of variables representing situations
                arising in the modeled systems.

                Essence of the Qualitative Dynamical Systems<br>Behavior Mathematical Modeling Technique
            </p>

            <p>
                In discussions about application of the technique of mathematical modeling of behavior of
                systems for creating dynamical models of behavior of the systems, the notion "modeling
                technique" is used to describe our knowledge, needed for creating models, on: 1) behavior
                of the modeled systems, 2) how the models are supposed to be organized, and 3) what the
                models should do in order for they be able to reproduce behavior of the modeled systems.
                And also, the understanding by using what kind of  mathematical tools such models can be created.
            </p>

            <p>
                So, for example, when creating models of behavior of quantitative systems, we create them based
                on the known dependence relations of future state of properties of systems on the current
                state of their  properties. And for computing values ​​of variables as the values of
                functions, that are computed as dependent ones on the independent values given to the functions
                as their arguments, we use mathematical sets of numbers whose elements are used to represent
                measured states of modeled properties, and operations defined on the sets making it possible
                to compute values ​​of variables of the models by transforming the values ​​of the
                arguments of the function into values of the functions.
            </p>

            <p>
                Accordingly, knowledge, when creating models of qualitative systems - is the knowledge about
                the nature of qualitative systems and the nature of the behavior of these systems,
                included in the specifications of the behavior of qualitative systems that were described
                on the page "Qualitative Dynamical Systems, their Behavior and Mathematical Modeling".
                The structure of these specifications reflects the dependence of the state of properties of
                the systems on the occurrence situations in them, and thus is the basis for determining
                the structure of mathematical expressions that can describe the processes of calculating
                a function. And the discrete nature of the state of the qualitative properties of systems
                described in the specifications suggests the representation of the states of properties in
                models of the system using a mathematical set of symbols, the elements of which can be used
                to represent the values ​​of the variables of models denoting the discrete states of
                the qualitative properties of the modeled systems.
            </p>

            <p>
                Accordingly, the content of the technique of modeling the behavior of qualitative systems,
                described below, begins with a description of the method for designating the values ​​of
                variables representing the states of the qualitative properties of the modeled system and
                determining the set of values ​​of the model variables, as well as description of
                transforming the specification of the behavior of a qualitative system, the elements of which
                are the identifiers of the properties of the systems and their states, into a description of
                the specifications of the behavior of model described in terms of variables of the models and
                their symbolic values. At the same time, the following sections continue the description of
                the modeling technique by considering the behavior of the model from the point of view of
                the dynamics of the emergence of situations in the system (and in the model) that cause the
                difficulties of describing the process of calculating the functions of the model in the form
                of a mathematical expression. However, application of developments of the modeling technique
                make it possible to eliminate the encountered difficulties by proposing a way of implementation
                of functions of models based on modeling solutions found in the process of exploration of
                possibility of mathematical modeling of the behavior of qualitative systems conducted in
                the Kaleidoscope project.

            <p class="section-header">
                Definition of Domain Set of Mathematical Models of Qualitative Systems
            </p>

            <p>
                When considering behavior of systems, we study their properties and changes of the properties.
                And for that, in order to be able to talk and describe the properties, we give the properties
                names, accept that they can be in different states, and describe the changes of the properties
                over time as processes of changes of their states. Therefore, while creating mathematical models
                of behavior of qualitative systems, capable of reproducing changes of properties of the systems
                over time, we have to define the models as collections of variables, representing the modeled
                properties, and designate different states of the variables, representing different states of
                the properties, by assigning to the variables values taken from the mathematical set, elements of
                which can represent qualitative states of properties of the modeled system; and which, thus, are
                considered the domain of the models.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thus, for instance, to denote the states of quantitative variables, sets of integers, real
                or complex numbers are used, the elements of which can represent quantities, and for denoting
                states of propositions, when describing logical reasoning, sets may be defined as containing
                two elements, such as are words: “true” and “false”, or symbols “T” and “F”, which are a way
                of representing logical assessments of the truth or falsity of statements. Therefore, to denote
                qualitative assessments of the states of properties, the number of which can be large, yet
                always finite, it is quite natural and convenient to define elements of the domain of  the
                system (and model) as a set of symbols. For example, to represent the computational part of
                the models, the set can be defined as a collection of uppercase letters of the Latin alphabet,
                and for representing models created in the form of a network of properties, which is intended
                to serve as the graphical representation of model, the set can be defined as a collection of
                different colors that are used for colorizing the properties in order to indicate their
                different states.
            </p>

            <p>
                In order to describe the modeling technique and the modeling solutions the technique proposes,
                further on, however, is used the base version of the set described as the collection of uppercase
                letters of the Latin alphabet; formal definition of which is given below:

                    <p>
                        Domain set D of the models of qualitative systems is the collection of uninterpreted uppercase letters of
                        Latin alphabet, that is described as: D = {A, B, C, ..., Z}. It serves as the domain and the range of the
                        state functions of variables of the models.

                Adaptation of the QSBSpec to Its Application for<br>Creating Models of Qualitative Systems
            </p>

            <p>
                Structure of the QSBSpec, presented in Figure 5 on the previous page “Qualitative Systems,
                Their Behavior and Mathematical Modeling” is general form of a qualitative system behavior
                specification defined in terms of identifiers of properties and states of the properties
                stored in the lists of pairs (unique identifier : text representing element of the specification).
                Respectively, in order to use QSBSpec as a part of the modeling technique discussed on this page,
                it has to be converted to the Qualitative Model Behavior Specification QMBSpec elements of which
                would have the same structure as the elements of the QSBSpec have. However, being intended to
                specify State Variable Dependence Specification, abbreviated to SVDSpec, elements of these
                specifications should be not unique identifiers of properties and the states of properties,
                but be rewritten as the UIDs of variables and states of variables described as the values of
                the variables taken from domain set D of the model.  Result of that conversion is presented
                in Figure 1.

                (2) Each i-th SVDSpeci{  xi   :  C j=0cn(i) { } } is defined as a pair where the first element
                of the pair xi  is the UID of dependent variable of the SVDSpeci whereas the second element is
                the list of Correspondences, iterator through which is denoted as C j=0cn(i) of i,j-th Correspondences.
            </p>

                (3) Each i,j-th Correspondence { cvi,jt+1  :  S k=0sn(i,j) {  } is also defined as a pair. In

                Feasibility of Development of Mathematical Models<br>of Qualitative Dynamical Systems
            </p>

            <p>
                When describing character of dependence of values ​​of variables while creating different
                models of quantitative systems, we always assume that computed values ​​of the functions
                φ(args), used in the state equations of variables x = φ(args) of the models, depend on all arguments
                of the functions, and that at each computation of the functions, all their arguments are always
                have valid values. Or, in the other words, that the values ​​of functions can be always computed
                for any combination of their arguments and that, as a consequence of this feature, such functions
                are considered the “total functions”.
            </p>

            <p>
                But the nature of the dependence of states ​of qualitative properties, described in
                the specifications of dependence of states of properties ​​on various situations arising
                in the systems at different times, proposes that the dependence of various values of functions
                ​​on various combinations of values ​​of various groups of their arguments
                characterizing various situations, is not always possible. And that makes such functions
                defined only partially.
            </p>

            <p>
                Therefore, one of the major tasks of the technique of modeling of qualitative systems is to
                define state functions of the variables of the models in such a way which gives them
                ability to compute next state of the variables in spite the fact that while computing
                the next state of the model at different moments in time, some groups of arguments of
                the functions may contain combinations of values recognizable as the expected
                situations and thus let the functions to compute their values corresponding to
                these situations, whereas the values of the functions for values of some other groups
                of arguments cannot be computed.

                To define a function, in a general sense, means to suggest a way for computing values of a
                function for all possible combinations of values of its arguments. And that means, in order to
                define the content of the procedure for computing state function of a variable of a model of a
                qualitative system, it is necessary to suggest a way for computing values of the function ​​for
                all combinations of values of groups of arguments, ​​representing expected situations,
                described in the QVDSpec. But this has to be done by taking into account that the suggested way
                for computing procedure must ensure obtaining computation results despite the characteristics of
                dependence of states of  variables of models on situations that create challenges to the process of
                computation of the functions.

                Content of Procedure of Computation of State Functions of<br> Variables and Challenges

            <p>
                Perhaps, one of the fundamental differences between the way of computing quantitative functions
                written in the form of an algebraic expression and functions that should compute values of
                variables of models of qualitative systems is the difference in the nature of the dependence
                relation of states of dependent variables of models of these systems on the state of the same
                or other variables of the models.
            </p>

            <p>
                The dependence of the state of quantitative variables on the state of the function arguments
                in models of the behavior of quantitative systems is characterized by the existence of
                correlations between the values ​​of the dependent variable of the relationship of
                dependence and all changes in the values ​​of the group of arguments that are independent
                elements of the relationship. Therefore, the mathematical expression of such functions is
                defined as an approximation of the observed correlation, which makes it possible to present
                the dependence in the form of a polynomial, the structure of which is described as the sum of
                the weighted, with the help of the coefficients, arguments of the function, the list of which
                never changes.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unlike the dependencies of quantitative variables, the dependence of the state of qualitative
                variables described in the specification of the dependence of variables on the occurrence of a
                combination of the state of groups of variables characterizing situations is determined as a
                list of pairs of correspondence between specific values ​​of variables and specific situations
                and therefore cannot be determined by transforming a group of arguments since such a single group
                of arguments does not exist. Calculations of the dependence of variables in models of qualitative
                systems should be ensured by passing two arguments to each function of the model: 1) the state of
                the calculated variable at the time of applying the function and listing of groups of properties
                characterizing the situations described in the Correspondences of the specification as causes of
                changes in the states of the variable.
            </p>

            <p>
                The first of these arguments is used either when none of the situations presented as a group
                of arguments determining the value of the function at the time of calculating the function exists,
                and therefore it is impossible to calculate the value of the function or when, due to the fact
                that various existing situations suggest changing the variable to different values. While the
                second argument - a list of groups of variables characterizes all situations described as causes
                of changes in the states of the variable and is therefore used to determine the proposed values
                of the variable, regardless of whether these groups contain the situations expected in the
                specification or not.
            </p>

            <p>
                Therefore, the mathematical expression of such functions must contain pairs of expected values
                characterizing expected situations and proposed values of the variable corresponding to the
                expected situations, taken from the description of the correspondence to the specification.
                And the process of computing the function must
            </p>

            <p>
                (1) identify which of the groups of arguments of the function contain the states described in
                the Correspondences as expected situations,
            </p>

            <p>
                (2) generate proposed values corresponding to the recognized situations (or mark the proposed
                values with some symbol different from the symbols of the set D to indicate that the proposed
                value is undefined,
            </p>

            <p>
                (3) analyze (after all proposed values have been generated) and determine on the basis of this
                analysis the final proposed value which, if it turns out to be defined, should become the next
                value of the function, and
            </p>

            <p>
                (4) find out whether the final proposed value is defined and if it is defined use it as the
                value of the function; or otherwise use the value of the auxiliary argument of the function
                containing the current value of the variable being calculated as the calculated value of the
                function the use of which as the calculated value should leave the state of the variable
                unchanged.
            </p>

            <p>
                Described in this section, the schema of computation of a state function may seem more like
                an algorithm of a computer program than an algebraic expression. And this is indeed so. It has
                too many checks of the state of the data, the purpose of which is to change the course
                computation depending on which situations are present in the model and which are not, on the
                one hand, and on which proposed values ​​were produced in the response to those existing
                or nonexistent situations, on the other hand. But, the feelings of frustration and hopelessness
                caused by the alleged infeasibility of computing state functions of models of qualitative
                systems in the form of algebraic expressions (arising while reading presented description) is
                not so completely hopeless as it may seem, since, as it has turned out, needed modeling solution
                exists, was found, and is going to be described right below.

                The considered content of the function calculation procedure, difficulties caused by the nature
                of the behavior of qualitative systems and the mechanism for resolving difficulties create an
                understanding of the saturation of the calculation target with a multitude of prophecies of
                the state of arguments and intermediate data of the algorithm, without the implementation of
                which the calculation of the function would be impossible. But this same adaptation of the
                algorithm to the changing state of the model, implemented by means of checking the state of
                arguments and the produced proposed values, the results of which are used to change the
                content of the steps of the algorithm, create uncertainty that the entire adaptation mechanism
                can be incorporated into the procedure for calculating the function, the implementation of
                which was originally conceived in the form of an algebraic expression.

                The structure of an algebraic expression may be defined as monomial, binomial, trinomial or
                polynomial, and should consist of constants and variables, but it may not include operations
                for analyzing data or controlling the order of execution of other operations in the expression.
                Therefore, the described content of the procedure of computation of the functions is perceived
                rather as the description of a computer program than as a diagram describing an algebraic
                expression.

                Characteristics of behavior and the way of organization of process of computing the qualitative
                states of variables, performed by calculating the functions of the state of variables described
                in the equations of state of variables, in the models of qualitative systems, are fundamentally
                different from characteristics of behavior and the way of computing quantitative states of
                variables in the models of quantitative systems. States of qualitative variables of models of
                qualitative systems are represented not by means of elements of numerical sets but by means of
                symbols taken from the domain set of the values of variables of models D.

                At the same time, estimates of the state of variables that can be obtained by simple comparison
                of the values ​​of variables, the results of which can be designated using elements taken
                from another set of symbols, for example, a set of auxiliary symbols defined as X = {"!", "~" and "#"}.
                And this homogeneity of the symbols of the set D and the set X creates a unique opportunity to
                combine both sets of symbols into one carrier set of the model S and then define on the created
                set a family of binary operations closed on it.

                operations are presented in the first column of the table. The second column contains symbols
                used to denote the operations in an expression where the operations are written in their infix

            </p>

<!--   O P E R A T I O N S         -->

            <p>
                First, Equivalence (?) operation is the first that begins computation of the procedure of a function.
                It is used to recognize situations, description of which is passed to a function as the groups of
                its arguments. When recognizing a particular situation, this operation compares all the values
                of a group of the arguments, which may or may not contain the description of the expected situation
                present in the model at the time of computation of the function, with their expected values. To
                perform this comparison, the operation takes two operands whose values are symbols of the set D
                and yields either symbol "!", which belongs to the set X, if both operands are represented by
                the same symbol of set D, or the value "~", which also belongs to the set X, if the operands are
                represented by different symbols of the set D.
            </p>

            <p>
                Second, Conjunction (&) operation is also used to recognize situations, or more precisely to
                compute the indicators representing the fact that all the results of comparing the states of
                properties with their expected values ​​obtained as a result of applying the Equivalence
                operation have been compared and thus the expected situation is recognized. It is called
                Conjunction because it inherits its role from the Conjunction operation defined on a set
                consisting of only two elements and solves the same problem. This operation takes two operands
                computed by the Equivalence operation by comparing its operands, each of which can be either
                the "!" symbol or the "~" symbol, and returns the "!" symbol only in case - when  both of its
                operands contain the "!" symbol, or the "~" symbol for all other combinations of operands.
                Properties of the commutativity and associativity of the Conjunction operation allow it to be
                used for computing n-ary conjunction of all results of the Equivalence operation, where the
                output of n-ary conjunction is the value "!" if and only if all results of the Equivalence
                operation are represented by the symbol "!", or the symbol "~" otherwise.
            </p>

            <p>
                Third, Production (*) operation is the generator of the  proposed state of the variable. It has gotten its name because it acts in the same
                way as the production rule. One of the operands of this operation is the result of recognition
                of the situation, i.e. it may contain either symbol "!" or "~" obtained after  computation
                of the n-ary conjunction accomplished by the Conjunction operation. While the second argument
                is the element of the set D, that is described in the Correspondence of the specification as
                the proposed value of the variable. The operation produces a proposed value of the variable
                that is a dependent element of the relation computed by the function in case when the operand,
                representing the result of recognition of situation "!" indicates that the situation is recognized,
                or the symbol "~" when the result of recognition is the symbol "~" meaning that the situation is
                not recognized.
            </p>

            <p>
                Fourth operation (|) is Disjunction. It is called Disjunction because in the process of
                computation of the function it plays a role similar to the role of the Disjunction operation
                of an algebra defined on a set of two elements. Its task is to look through all the proposed
                values and do the best to find a single "final proposed value" which should become the value
                of the function, and thus the next value of the state variable of the model. So, to accomplish
                the task this operation takes two operands that can be represented by any symbols of the set S.
                And it is commutative and associative, similar to the Conjunction operation, it is used to
                compute the n-ary disjunction of all the results of the Production operation.  In the process
                of this computation, it selects from all the proposed values ​​produced by the Production
                operation a single final proposed value that should become the value  of the function (and the
                next value of the state variable of a model) if such a value can be found among all the
                proposed values ​​produced as corresponding to all situations, regardless of whether
                the situation is recognized or not. There are three possible outcomes of the application of
                this operation produced as a final proposed value. Based on the following three rules.
            </p>

            <p>
                1) It yields symbol "~" when it turns out that none of the expected situations that are
                independent elements in relation to the dependence of the variable on the situation were
                recognized since none of them are present in the state of the function arguments;
            </p>

            <p>
                2) It yields a symbol “d” that is an element of the set D, produced by the Production operation,
                as corresponding to the recognized situations in the case when one or more expected situations
                turned out to be present in the state of the arguments of a function and all recognized
                situations (when there are several of them) have produced the same proposed value of the variable.
            </p>

                3) Or, it yields the symbol "#" denoting the case when at least two of the expected situations
                are present in the model (and the arguments of a function) and are recognized, but corresponding
                to the situations proposed values ​​require the computed variable to simultaneously take
                different values. And since the function, by definition, can compute only one value, it is
                interpreted by the next operation as the fact that the final proposed value that this operation
                should produce could not be found among the previously calculated proposed values. And.

            <p>
                Fifth operation (<) Application is the last one in the procedure of computation of a function.
                Yet, its role has nothing to do with the continuation of computation of the function. It is used
                to redefine the function by transforming it from partially defined to defined on all possible
                combinations of its arguments (whether they represent or not represent situations) and, thus,
                for eliminating cases when, due to a conflict of values ​​detected by the Disjunction
                operation, the final value turned out to be undefined; that is, to transform a partially defined
                function into a complete one. In solving this problem, the Application operation, like all previous
                operations, also takes two operands. But unlike all previous operations, it is not commutative.
                Its first operand is the final proposed value (calculated or not by the Disjunction operation),
                and the second is an additional argument of the function containing the current value of the
                variable, in case the calculation of the next value of the variable may not work. Thus, all this
                operation does is check the type of the final proposed value of the function passed to it as
                its first operand and determine the computed value of the function using the final proposed value
                if that value is represented by an element of the D sets, i.e., is a real symbol representing
                the next state of the variable. Or, alternatively, use the value of the additional argument of
                the function which is the current value of the function which should replace the unevaluated
                final proposed value.

                The example of an equation defined in accordance with above formula describing dependence of
                values of a variable “x0” on the combinations of values of variables x1, x2 and x3 which
                characterize two situations (x1), and (x2, x3) that may arise in a particular system, is
                presented as equation.
            </p>

            <p>
                x0 = x0 < [ ( P * (x1 ? E) )  |  ( H * ( (x2 ? M) & (x3 ? Q) ) ) ];       (1)
            </p>

            <p>
                This simple equation states that the two values which variable x0 can take are determined by
                two situations and hence two correspondences. The first (left to right) Correspondences
                describes that variable x0 should take value P when value of variable x1 is E, whereas the
                second Correspondence  describes that variable x0 should take value H when value of variable
                x2 is M, while the value  of variable x3 is simultaneously marked by symbol Q. In spite of
                such simple dependence, different combinations of values of independent variables (arguments)
                of the expression: x1, x2 and x3 may cause the expression can be computed with different
                results and thus would create at least three different values of the variable x0. All these
                cases are considered and illustrated in the next section, which describes every single step of
                the computation of the expression in all the details.

                Illustrative Example of Process of Computation of<br>Values of Variable of Qualitative State Equation
            </p>

            <p>
                Proposed in previous sections, solutions for modeling qualitative dependencies, based on the
                hybrid set S, make it possible to describe dependence of changes of values of a qualitative
                variable on various emerging and disappearing situations. An example, presented in (1),
                represents such dependence in the form of algebraic equation, utilizes elements of the set
                S for denoting values of variables, and computes the algebraic expression, located in the
                right part of the equation, as the composition of operations defined on the set S. Now,
                the content of this section is intended to illustrate application of the elements and the
                operations of the set S in the process of computation of the expression of the equation (1).
                The content of the proposed example is presented in Figure 1 which has four sections: a, b,
                c and d.
            </p>

            <p>
                All four sections of the example illustrate the process of computation of a certain value
                of the dependent variable x0, of the same equation (1), depending on a particular combination
                of values of the variables: x1, x2 and x3, which are the arguments of the expression
                being computed. Therefore, in order to show how the expression obtains different results,
                each of the four sections begins with the initialization of the computed value x0 with
                always the same value G, but with each time different values ​​of the variables:
                x1, x2 and x3.
            </p>

            <p>
                Six lines, in each section, following the line of initialization, depict the results of
                successive application of five operations: ?, &, *, | and <, causing the change in the
                state of the process of computation of the expression. These changes are expressed in
                the diagram as a replacement in each following line, presenting the result of the operation,
                of that part of the line which holds the construct: "operand-operation-operand" representing
                executed operation by the value produced by this operation. The arrows located between the
                lines in section "a", directed vertically downwards from the sign of the operation to the
                symbol depicting the result of the application of the operation, serve for drawing attention
                to the operation performed. They are used at each of the computation steps in section "a" only,
                but not placed in the remaining three sections since all these sections depict the same
                execution process while the difference in the content of computation is determined by different
                values assigned to the arguments of the expression at time of their initialization. Here
                below is Figure 1a followed by the detailed description of steps of execution of the operations.

            <p>
                Figure 1a provides a detailed description of the steps of computation of the expression.
                It illustrates the case when the arguments of the expression are initialized as x0 = G;
                x1 = L; x2 = M; x3 = Q; and thus the situation (x1) is not present and is not recognized,
                but the situation (x2, x3) is present and recognized. Therefore the produced proposed
                value “H” of the variable x0 is computed as the correspondence to the situation (x2, x3).
                So, the operations Disjunction and Application choose and accept it as the valid value of
                the variable x0. Further description of the process of computation of values of the variable
                x0 of this case proceeds as the detailed description of five steps of execution of five
                operations ?, &, *, |, < constituting the expression.
            </p>

            <p>
                Step 1 is performed as the execution of the Equivalence (?) operation which is applied to
                the situation (x1), presented as a group of variables consisting of only one variable x1,
                and to the situation (x2, x3), presented as a group consisting of two variables x2 and x3.
                So, as it follows from the structure of the expression, the task of this operation is to
                test if the current value of each variable is the same as its expected one.  In Figure 1a,
                the application of this operation is depicted as three arrows directed vertically from the
                sign of the Equivalence operation “?” to the symbol yielded as the result depending on the
                operands of the operation. Thus, as the value of the variable x1 is “L” and its expected
                value is “E” the application of the Equivalence operation to these operands yields the
                symbol of “$” - indicating that the value “L” of operand x1 and constant “E” are not the same.
                Yet, at the same time, the value “M” of variable x2 is the same as the constant “M'' and
                the value “Q” of the variable x3 is the same as the constant “N”. Hence, application of
                the Equivalence operation to both pairs of the second situation yields the auxiliary symbol “!”.
            </p>

            <p>
                Step 2 is performed by the Conjunction (&) operation. The task of this operation is to compute
                the conjunction of all results of the Equivalence operation and thus show that all the
                current values of the independent variables characterizing the situation have been compared with
                the expected ones and therefore the expected situation is present in the state of the model
                and thus is considered as recognized. So, this operation is used to conduct the test for the
                results of the Equivalence operations yielded for each situation. So, to confirm the recognition,
                the operands of the Conjunction operation may be different combinations of symbols “!” and “$”
                therefore the role of the operation is, in respect to the values of operands, is absolutely the
                same as the behavior of the well known boolean Conjunction operating with the values named “true”
                and “false”. The application of this operation, in the considered case, is depicted as one arrow
                directed from the sign “&” of this operation to the symbol yielded as its result; in this case it
                is symbol “!”.
            </p>

            <p>
                Step 3 is performed by the Product (*) operation. The output of this operation is a proposed
                value that is produced as the correspondence to recognized or not recognized situation. Depending
                on the result of the recognition of situation performed by the Equivalence and Conjunction
                operations, the proposed value produced by the Production operation may be presented as either
                the constant corresponding to the recognized situation described in the Correspondence sub-expression
                and located as the operand of the Production operand placed on the left side of the operation,
                or as the symbol "$" already used to indicate the fact that the situation was not recognized.
                On the Figure 1a, application of the Production operation is depicted as one arrow directed from
                the sign “*” to the domain symbol “H” yielded as result of the application of the operation to
                its operands, given as symbols of “H” and “!”.
            </p>

            <p>
                Step 4 is performed by the Disjunction (|) operation. The execution of this step begins when
                all proposed values ​​of a variable are already determined by the three previous steps,
                and consists in choosing the final proposed value out of all produced proposed values. So, to
                accomplish that choice the Disjunction operation analyzes all the proposed values one by one
                and selects from them the only final value of the computation process that serves as a candidate
                to become the next value of the variable. Therefore, as it is defined by the mechanism of this
                operation, its result can be yielded as either a) an auxiliary symbol “$”, indicating the fact
                that none of the expected situations is recognized, b) an element of the set D, when one or more
                situations are recognized and all produced as the correspondence to recognized situations proposed
                values are represented by the same element of the set D, or c) an auxiliary symbol “#”, indicating
                the fact that two or more of the recognized situations produced proposed values represented by the
                different elements of the set D, and thus created the conflict in choosing the single final value
                of computation. In Figure 1a the Disjunction operation takes operands given as symbols “$” and “H”
                and therefore chooses of them as the final proposed values symbol “H”;
            </p>

            <p>
                Step 5 is performed by the Application (<) operation. This operation is the guard of the computed
                value of the variable of the equation. It takes two operands: the current value of the variable
                and the final proposed value - produced by the Disjunction operation, which can be either the
                element of the set D or the one of the symbols of the set X. Following its role of guarding, this
                operation is to prevent any symbol, other than those that represent the valid next value of the
                variable, from becoming the result of the computation of the expression. So, the operation checks
                if the final proposed value, given to it as the operand is a symbol of set D and if it is then
                yields the  final proposed value, or otherwise (when the final proposed value is a symbol belonging
                to set X indicating that the next value of the variable is not computed) yields the first operand
                representing the variable’s current value, that leads to the value of the variable in fact will be
                left unmodified. In the Figure 1a the yielded by the Disjunction operation result is represented
                by symbols “H”, therefore next computed value of the variable is computed as the symbol “H”
            </p>

                Execution of step 5 completes the description of computation of the expression, presented in Figure 1a.

                initialization of the variables: x1, x2, x3, that make the expression, in spite of the same
                order of the application of the operations, to compute the expression differently. That is, in
                fact, based on the internal analysis, conducted by the operations that make them to produce
                different values of the variables corresponding to different situations presented by arguments of

                x3 = Q; This makes both: the situation (x1) and the situation (x2, x3) are recognized, and,
                as the consequence of that, the produced proposed values “P” and “H” create uncertainty in
                choosing the final value of the variable x0 accomplished by the Disjunction operation that in
                that case marks the final proposed values by symbol “#” to indicate that the final value is not

                Figure 1d illustrates case opposite to the case 1b. In this case the arguments of the expression
                are set as  x0 = G; x1 = R; x2 = M; x3 = Z; This makes that none of the expected situations is
                present and, hence, none of the expected situations is recognized. And so, as a consequence of
                that, both proposed values of the variable are marked with the symbol “$”. And therefore, similar
                to the case 1b, the Application operation leaves the value of the variable x0 in its current
                value “G”.

                And as it often happens, obtaining an answer to one question may immediately pave the road
                to the emergence of the next one, a more general question. So, obtaining the answers to two
                questions, asked at the beginning of this page, immediately sparks interest in getting the
                answer to the new question: “How should the models of the qualitative systems be organized?”.
                All the remaining pages of the description of the project are devoted to answering this question.
                And the description of this starts right on the next page providing the more formal definition
                to described on this page set S and its five operations as the algebra, named “The Algebra of
                Symbols” and continues as presentations of other modeling solution proposing representation of
                the system of qualitative equations of the model based on the Vector State Space approach and
                the Graph Based Multi Colored Logical Net (McLN) modeling formalism, creation of which is
                supported by the application named Qualitative Systems Modeling and Simulating Environment.
