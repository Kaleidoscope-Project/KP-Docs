            <p>
                The Algebra of Symbols (AoS) is a common name for an algebraic structure, whose
                operations are defined on the set of symbols. It has been constructed as part of
                the Kaleidoscope project, and is thought up for mathematical modeling of the
                behavior of the Qualitative Dynamical Systems (QDS)s. The algebra, thus, is a source of
                symbols used for denoting the values of the qualitative variables representing states of
                modeled properties of the QDSs, from the one hand, and the operations needed for computation of
                qualitative multivalued dependence relations of the variables, on the other hand. It is, therefore,
                used within the project for creating experimental mathematical models of QDSs of varying
                degrees of complexity. So, the meaning of operations of the Algebra is determined by the
                nature of the qualitative dynamical systems for modeling of which it is used.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Algebra of Symbols (AoS) is built on a set of symbols and is a collection of operations,
                defined on that set. The algebra serves as instrument for developing mathematical models of
                qualitative dynamical systems that represents qualitative properties of the modeled systems
                as qualitative variables taking their values from the set of symbols of the algebra, on the
                one hand, and describes behavior of the systems in the form of algebraic expressions written
                as composition of operations of the algebra, on the other hand.

                in the definition of an algebra more general role - it is the zero element of the algebra.
                It is the absorption element of operations Equivalence and Production and the identity element
                of operations Conjunction and Disjunction of the algebra.

                Provided below definitions of operations of the Algebra, for visualization and convenience
                of description of the rules of work of the operations, are presented in the form of small
                square 9 x 9 tables, framed by the headings located on the left and the top sides of the
                tables, which contain the symbol of the operation and the symbols of the operation’s operands.
                Table cells present symbols that the operations return for the operands indicated in the
                headers of their rows and columns. The tables defining operations Equivalence, Conjunction,
                Production and Disjunction are symmetrical about their main diagonal; that is, of the
                line connecting their upper left and lower right corners. The order of values passed to
                these operations as their operands is, therefore, irrelevant. Unlike these four operations,
                the table defining the Application operation is not symmetrical. The behavior of this
                operation is explained by its role in the process of computation, which is described below.
            </p>

            <p>
                Highlighted with greenish color headers of the tables indicate values of the operands
                used when the operations are applied for computation of qualitative functional dependencies
                of some variables of qualitative mathematical expressions on the values of other variables;
                whereas groups of cells highlighted in the orange color indicate output of the operations
                being yielded during the process of computation of the expressions.

                The accompanying definition of the operations, their short annotations are expanded later,
                when the roles of the operations in the process of computation of qualitative mathematical
                models of behavior of the qualitative dynamical systems is considered.

                        The Equivalence operation is denoted by the symbol <b>"?"</b>. It is used in the process of
                        recognition of situations and is used to compare the current values of a group of
                        variables of a model, a particular combination of which characterizes a certain situation
                        possible in the system with values describing the expected situation.

                            the set <b>X</b>; where the character "!" denotes the fact that the characters
                            representing the values of the arguments turned out to be the same, and the symbol

                        operation, this operation is used in the process of recognition of the situations. The
                        operation is applied to the results of the Equivalence operation to confirm that all
                        the results of its comparison of the current state of the variables of the model and

                            "$". Acting like the classical conjunction operator, it returns the symbol "!" only
                            in case when its arguments turn out to be the symbol "!". For all other combinations
                            of argument, it returns the "$" symbol.

                        The Production operation is denoted by the symbol <b>"*"</b>. The role of this operation in the
                        process of computation of the state equation of the system is to produce the value of the
                        proposed next state of the system corresponding to the recognized situation. Therefore,
                        it is applied to the result of the recognition of a situation obtained after the
                        multivalued conjunction has been assessed.

                            This operation takes two arguments, one of which (let's say is the first one) is the
                            symbol the operation is to produce, i.e. the symbol of the set <b>D</b>, and the second is a
                            symbol denoting the fact of recognition or not recognition of the situation, i.e.
                            symbol "!" or "$" of <b>X</b> set. The operation returns value of the first argument when
                            its second argument confirms the fact that the situation was recognised, or the symbol
                            "$", i.e. the value of the second argument, when the situation was unrecognized.

                    <p>
                        The Disjunction operation is denoted by the symbol <b>"|"</b>. Like the Conjunction operation,
                        it
                        is performed after the preceding element-by-element operation applied to a group of the
                        pairs of symbols. And in this case, it is used to combine the results of the Production
                        operation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each variable of the model can, in the process of modeling the behavior of the system, take
                        on different states, denoted by symbols from the set <b>D</b>, corresponding to different and
                        possibly simultaneously occurring situations. At the same time, situations occurring
                        simultaneously may suggest changes in the state of the variable, transferring it to the
                        same or different states. Therefore, the role of the Disjunction operation in the process
                        of generating the next state of the system is to process all the results proposed by the
                        Production operation and obtain the only final value proposed as the next state of the
                        model variable.

                            This operation takes two arguments, each of which can be either a symbol of the set symbol
                            <b>D</b> or a symbol of the set <b>X</b>, and produces a result that may also be either a
                            symbol
                            of the set symbol <b>D</b> or a symbol of the set <b>X</b>. It returns the $ symbol when
                            none of the
                            expected situations is recognized; a symbol of either argument when both of its arguments
                            are the same symbol from <b>D</b>; or the symbol "#" when either its arguments are different
                            symbols of set <b>D</b>, or when any (or both) of its arguments are the symbol "#".

                        The Application operation is denoted by the symbol <b>"<?>"</b>. This operation is the final one
                        in
                        the XDNF calculation scheme and is used to inject into the current state of the system the
                        result of calculating the next state of the level of the proposed value obtained at the
                        previous steps of the calculation. This proposed value can be represented by the symbol
                        of the set <b>D</b>. But it may also turn out that in the process of calculating the next state
                        of the system, none of the expected situations occurred and therefore the proposed value
                        of the next state is not calculated. As described above, in this case, the model can be
                        represented by one of the characters: "-", "$" or "#". Therefore, the task of the Apply
                        operation is to replace the current value of the state of the variable in the case when
                        the proposed next state of the system is defined, i.e. represented by any character from
                        the set D, or do not change the current value of the variable otherwise.

                            Unlike all other algebra operations, this operation is non-commutative, so the order
                            of the arguments passed to it is important. Its first argument is the current value and
                            the second argument is the proposed value of the variable being evaluated. The operation
                            returns the value of the second argument (i.e., the proposed value) when the symbol
                            representing it belongs to the set <b>D</b>, or the value of the first argument (i.e., the
                            current state of the variable) when the proposed value is undefined, i.e. is any
                            of the symbols belonging to the set <b>X</b>.

            All the described operations of the algebra are closed under the set S, and therefore can be used in the
            mathematical expressions written as a composition of the operations. Also, as it can be seen
            from the definitions of the operations, the auxiliary symbol “-” is zero of the multiplications
            and additions operations, and thus is the absorption element of both multiplication operations
            and is the identity element of both addition operations.

            This table contains five columns
            representing result of testing of all five operations: Equivalence Conjunction, Production.
            Disjunction and Application. The result of testing each operation is provided in the form of
            a row of seven space-separated elements located below the separation line.

        <p>
            The first two elements of the row represent testing result whether the operation is commutative
            and associative, while the remaining five elements represent test results whether the operation
            is distributive with each of the five operations. These operations are designated by the first
            letter, taken from their names, and are located above each of the five elements. Adherence of
            the operations to the commutativity law is designated by the letter C, to the associativity
            law by the letter A, and to the distributivity law by the letter D. Case when result of the
            test is not confirmed is designated by the letter N. So, while interpreting the letters: C,
            A, D, and N one would say that:

            Application of the Algebra of Symbols
        </p>

        <p>
            Application of the algebra to creation of qualitative system models includes creation of a
            collection of qualitative variables, called variable assertions, names and values of which
            represent names and states of modeled properties, as well as description of dependence
            relations of the state of some variables of model on the state of others, in the form of
            a functional equation. The left side in this equation is an independent variable of the
            equation, the state of which is calculated on the right side of the equation, and the
            right side contains description of the procedure of computation of the value of the
            variable located on the left side. This part is written in the form of expression of the
            algebra of symbols. Its structure is an extension of the principle of representation of
            binary functions, known as disjunctive normal form - DNF, to the description of expressions
            whose variables are multivalued variables of the algebra of symbols. To emphasize the
            fact that this notation is a generalization of DNF, it is called XDNF. The letter <b>X</b> in
            the name of the generalized DNF is a reminder that in the process of its computation, a
            subset of auxiliary symbols of the set S, denoted by the letter <b>X</b> in the definition of
            the algebra of symbols, is used.
