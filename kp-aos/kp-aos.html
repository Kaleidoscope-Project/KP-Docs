                The Algebra of Symbols (AoS) is a common name for a particular algebraic structure, consisting
                of the set of symbols and a family of five operations defined on this set. It has been
                constructed as part of the Kaleidoscope project, and is thought up for mathematical modeling of
                behavior of the Qualitative Dynamical Systems (QDS)s. The algebra, thus, is a source of symbols
                used for denoting the values of the variables of the models  of the QDSs, representing states
                of properties of the modeled systems, on the one hand, and of the operations needed for computation
                of the multivalued qualitative dependence relations of the states of certain variables on the
                states of some other variables, that determine evolution of the state of the models over time,
                on the other hand.
            </p>

            <p>
                Within the project, the AoS is used for creating experimental mathematical models of the QDSs
                of varying degree of complexity. So, the meaning of the operations of the algebra is determined
                by the nature of the qualitative dynamical systems for modeling behavior of which the AoS is created.

                Provided below definitions of the operations of the Algebra, for visualization and convenience
                of description of the rules of their work, are presented in the form of small 9 x 9 square
                tables, framed by the headings of the rows and the columns located on the left and the top
                sides of the tables, respectively. These headings specify symbols that can be used as the
                operands of the operations. The symbol located in the upper left corner of the table is the
                symbol of the operation. Table cells present symbols that the operations return for the
                operands listed in the headers of their rows and columns. The tables defining the Equivalence,
                the Conjunction, the Production and the Disjunction operations are symmetrical about their
                main diagonal; that is, of the line connecting their upper left and lower right corners.
                The order of values passed to these operations as their operands is, therefore, irrelevant.
                Unlike these four operations, the table defining the Application operation is not symmetrical.
                Such definition of this operation is justified by its role in the process of computation of the
                algebraic expressions, which is described below.
            </p>

            <p>
                Headers of the tables highlighted with greenish color indicate values of the operands
                used when the operations are applied for computation of qualitative functional dependencies
                of some variables of qualitative mathematical expressions on the values of other variables.
                On the other hand, groups of cells highlighted in the orange color indicate output of the
                operations being yielded when they are used for computing these mathematical expressions.

            All the described operations of the algebra are closed under the set <b>S</b>, and, therefore,
            can be used in the mathematical expressions written as a composition of the operations. Also,
            as it can be seen from the definitions of the operations, the auxiliary symbol “-” is the kind
            of "zero" of the "multiplication" and the "addition" operations of the algebra, and, thus, is

<!--            assumes defining a collection of qualitative variables, names and values of which represent-->
<!--            names and states of modeled properties, as well as description of dependence relations of the-->
<!--            state of some variables of model on the state of others, in the form of a functional equations.-->
<!--            The left side in these equations is an independent variable of the equation, the state of which-->
<!--            is computed by the right side of the equation, and the right side is the description of the-->
<!--            procedure of computation of the value of the variable located on the left side. This procedure is-->
<!--            written in the form of expression of the algebra of symbols. Its structure is an extension of-->
<!--            the principle of representation of binary functions, known as disjunctive normal form - DNF,-->
<!--            that consists of the multivalued variables and the operations of the algebra of symbols. To-->
<!--            emphasize the fact that, this notation is a generalization of DNF, it is referred to as the XDNF,-->
<!--            where the letter "X" in the name in the form XDNF is the remainder of the fact that the process of-->
<!--            computation of the expression, relays on the subset <b>X</b> of auxiliary symbols of the set-->
