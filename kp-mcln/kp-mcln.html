            <p>
                This page introduces the Multicolored Logical Net Modeling Formalism, or McLN MF,
                intended for creating graphical models of qualitative dynamical systems and reproducing
                their behavior on a computer screen.

                Respectively, in order to enable, not only representation of the properties of the modeled
                systems and their states, in the models, but also reproducing changes in the state of
                the properties, depending on changes of the state of other properties, McLN models are
                created based on the notion of a bipartite directed graph, the elements of which are
                considered to be the simple discrete devices that are endowed with the ability to take
                different qualitative states, on the one hand, and have a certain number of inputs and
                outputs necessary for the interaction of elements with each other, on the other hand.
            </p>

            <p>
                The elements of these models, thus, are the representations of such elements of
                the modeled systems as the Properties, Conditions triggering changes of state of the
                Properties, Dependencies of the state of Conditions on the state of Properties and Dependencies
                of the state of Properties on the state of Conditions. Therefore, the McLN models can
                be, naturally, created as the graphical nets that are characterized by their structure, and
                by the mechanism of reproducing behavior of the modeled systems that is enabled by endowing
                the elements of the structure with the ability to perform operations of the Algebra of
                Symbols.
            </p>

            <p>
                So, the McLN model is constructed of two types
                of nodes. The Property nodes, depicted as the big circles or big hexagons states of which are
                denoted by solid color that fills their surfaces. The Condition nodes, serving as the conditions
                of changes of states of Property nodes, depicted as the small circles, that are filled with the
                solid white color and the sign "+" drawn on it, when the condition is satisfied, or by just
                the solid gray color, when it is not satisfied. And the two types of Arcs directed form the
                Property nodes to the Conditions nodes, and from the Conditions nodes to the Property nodes.
                Simple example of the McLN model is presented in Figure 1.

            <p style = "text-align: center;">
                <b>Figure 1.</b> One Property depending on three situations.
            </p>

            <p>
                Property nodes represent properties and states of the properties of the modeled systems, where
                the states are denoted as solid color that fills the circles or the hexagons. Conditions nodes
                are the conditions of changes of states of Property nodes. They represent facts of existence of
                expected situations that cause Property nodes, dependent on occurrence of situations, to change
                their states. Hence, states of Conditions nodes may either represent the fact that the expected
                situation is recognized or the fact that it is not recognized. These states are represented as
                the solid white color with symbol "+" drawn on it, or as just the solid gray color, respectively.
            </p>

            <p>
                Arcs directed from a group of the Property nodes to a Condition node represent dependence of the fact
                of recognition of an expected situation on a certain combination of states of Property nodes. These
                arcs are marked with the colored dots, particular colors of which are those expected states
                that the arcs’ input Properties should have in order for the situation to be deemed as
                existing and recognized.
            </p>

            <p>
                Arcs directed from a Condition node to some Property nodes represent dependence
                of the state of the Property nodes on the fact of the existence of the expected situation. These
                arcs have a small arrow heads marked with that colors of the proposed states which
                the arcs' output Property nodes should take when the state of the Condition node indicates the fact
                that the expected situation exists.
            </p>

            <p>
                So, the structure of the McLN literally means that the state of each Condition node depends on
                the state of one or more of its input Property nodes, characterizing a particular expected situation
                determined by the colors of the dots marking the Properties' output arcs.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the same
                time, the state of each Property node depends on the state of
                one or more of its input Condition nodes, and takes state represented by the color of the arrowhead
                of the arc directed form the Condition node to the dependent Property node in case when the state of
                the Condition indicates that all its input Properties represent expected situation denoted by
                the marks of their output arcs.
                <br><br>
                <em>Exclusion</em>>: Case when the state of Condition indicates that the expected situation is
                not recognized, or case when two or more Conditions suggest that dependent on different recognized
                situations Property should take different states are ignored and current state of the dependent
                property stays unchanged.
