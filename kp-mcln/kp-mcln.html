                When reasoning about and discussing behavior of discrete action systems at
                the everyday level regardless of be they living organisms, devices created by
                us, or systems of computer programs that imitate behavior of the both, we
                basically pay attention to the actions which these systems perform. And that
                is understandable. We know which of the actions would make no harm (and
                even may be useful), or, on the contrary, be quite dangerous. And this is
                exactly what is important in the context of our conversations about the
                systems. Therefore, while studying the essence of mechanisms of behavior of
                the systems, we want to know not only what kind of actions systems can
                perform. We want to understand why they perform those or other actions.
                And to learn that, it is necessary to know what actually happens in the systems
                right before they activate actions and right after the actions have been completed.

                Respectively, the nature of behavior of qualitative systems described on the
                page: "Qualitative Dynamical Systems, Their Behavior, and Mathematical
                Modeling" and the modeling solutions described on the page: "Qualitative
                Dynamical Systems Mathematical Modeling Technique" propose creation of
                models of qualitative systems capable of reproducing their behavior by
                changing state of variables of the models in accordance with the
                occurrence of situations considered as causes of changes observed in the
                systems, and thus reproduced in the models.

                This page describes graphical modeling formalism called the Multicolor
                Logical Net (McLN) intended for representing: properties of the modeled system,
                facts of occurrence of situations, and dependencies of facts on the current
                state of properties and the next state of properties on the state of facts in
                the form of a bipartite directed graph.

                Representation of McLN model in the form of bipartite graph

            <p>
                Example of popular, and therefore well known model of asynchronous discrete system
                called: "Dining Philosophers" states of properties of which are considered qualitative
                is presented in the figure 1.

                <b>Figure 1.</b> Model of qualitative dynamical system: “Dining Philosophers”.
            </p>

            <p>
                In this example the model is implemented as the McLN, and thus in the form of
                a bipartite directed graph. Hence, all the properties of the modeled system
                which are the five Philosophers and five Chopsticks, depicted in the model as
                the big and small circles, respectively.
            </p>

            <p>
                According to observed behavior of the modeled system real Philosophers may
                be in four different stated: Contemplating, Hungry, Waiting for Availability
                of Chopsticks and Dining. Their behavior iterates through named four states
                where state Dining transitions to state Contemplating and circle repeats.
            </p>

            <p>
                Behavior of this model is driven by two external input events where the first one causes
                feeling of hungriness, and the second indicates that the period of Dining is ended with
                satisfaction and the philosopher may proceed with strolling and contemplating again.
            </p>

            <p>
                Both of these input events are generated by the Qualitative Dynamical System Modeling &
                Simulation Environment used for creating McLN models and simulation of their behavior.
                These input events are provided with the help of a list of tick/action pairs, called a
                State Driven Program. While, the program is being created and associated with a property
                whose state can change as a result of external input-events, during constructing of the model.
