                This page introduces Multicolor Logical Net Modeling Formalism, or McLN MF, which
                is intended for creating models of the behavior of qualitative dynamical systems in the form
                of their graphical models.
            </p>

            <p>
                McLN models can be assembled, on a computer screen, using four graphical
                elements - properties, facts, dependence of facts on properties
                and the dependence of the properties on the facts. Accordingly,
                the McLN MF can be considered as the graphical construction set consisting of four
                elements. Therefore, the McLN model is, indeed, created as the graphical net, structure of
                which is based on the notion of bipartite directed graph, while the mechanism of reproducing behavior of
                the modeled system is provided by associating with the elements of the graph operations of the AoS.

                Structure of the McLN Model
<!--                Representation of McLN Model in the Form of Bipartite Oriented Graph-->
            </p>

            <p>
                Being based on the notion of bipartite directed graph, the McLN model is constructed of two types
                of nodes, depicted as the big and small circles, and two types of arcs directed form big to
                small, and from small to big circles. Simple example of McLN model is presented in Figure 1.
            </p>

            </p>


            <p>
                Big circles are the Properties. They represent properties and states of the properties of the
                modeled systems, which are indicated as solid color that fills the circles. Small circles are the
                Conditions causing changes of states of Properties. Hence, their states may either represent
                fact that expected situation is recognized or the fact that it is not recognized. These
                states of are represented as the solid white or gray colors, respectively.
            </p>

<!--            <p>-->
<!--                Big nodes represent Properties of the modeled systems, states of which are indicated as-->
<!--                solid color that fills the circles. Small circles are the facts state of which may either-->
<!--                assert that: “The expected situation recognized” or that “The expected situation not-->
<!--                recognized”. These states are represented as a solid white (situation is recognized) or-->
<!--                gray (situation is not recognized) color, that fills the circles of the Condition node,-->
<!--                respectively.-->
<!--            </p>-->

            <p>
                Arcs directed from Property nodes to a Condition node represent dependence of the fact
                of recognition of situation on a certain combination of states of Property nodes. These
                arcs are marked with the colored dots, particular colors of which are those expected states
                that the arcs’ input Properties should have in order for the situation to be deemed as
                existing and to be recognized.
            </p>

            <p>
                Arcs directed from a Condition node to some Property nodes represent dependence
                of the state of the Property nodes on the fact of existence of the expected situation. These
                arcs have a small arrow head marked with the color of that proposed state which
                the arcs' output Property nodes should take when the state of Condition node indicate fact
                that the expected situation is exists.
<!--                is generated as the proposed state of-->

            </p>

            <p>
                So, structure of the McLN literally mean that the state of each Condition node depends on
                the state of one or more of its input Property nodes, characterizing particular expected situation
                determined by the colors of the dots marking the Properties' output arcs. And, at the same
                time, the state of each Property node depends on the state of
                one or more of its input Condition nodes, and should take state denoted by the color marking the arrow head
                of the arc directed form the Condition node to the dependent Property node in case when the
                Condition indicates that all its input Properties represent expected situation denoted by
                the marks of their output arcs.

                Reproducibility of Behavior of Modeled System in<br>McLN Model
            </p>

            <p>
                Although pure mathematically, the bipartite directed graph is merely two sets of nodes
                connected by the directed arcs, the McLN model of a qualitative dynamical system, structure
                of which is based on the bipartite graph, in addition to the roles assigned to the elements of the
                graph, described above, should also be capable of reproducing behavior of modeled
                system. And that means the graph should have in its possession a collection of functions associated
                with its elements. These functions have to ensure certain transformations of states
                of Property nodes, and the motion of their states from some Property nodes to others.
                And, thus, all that activity should be performed by the Property nodes, Condition nodes and by the both
                types of the arcs of the graph itself. And this is achieved by endowing each element of the
                model with the ability to perform operation of the algebra of symbol, associated with it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Execution of the model assumes that the states of its all properties are always defined.
                Accordingly, performance of the operations of the elements of the model always begins
                with identifying situations present in the model.
            </p>

            <p>
                Arcs directed from Properties to Conditions are recognizers of expected states of their
                input Properties. Respectively, each this arc implements the Equivalence operation, which
                compares the color of its input Property with the color that marks the arc.
            </p>

            <p>
                Conditions perform recognition of the fact of presence of the expected situation in the model.
                Therefore, each input arc of the Condition implements Conjunction operation, task of which
                is to compute conjunction of all the results of comparisons performed by its input arcs.
            </p>

            <p>
                Arcs directed from Condition to Properties are generators of the proposed state of their
                output Properties. They implement Production operations. The task of each such arc
                is to produce proposed state represented by the color marking the arrowhead of the arc in the
                case when state of its input Condition is the fact of the existence of the expected
                situation. Or, alternatively, to produce proposed state represented by the color indicating
                that the expected situation is not recognized.
            </p>

            <p>
                Properties accept results produced by arcs directed to them from all Conditions. Each
                Property should accept state computed based on all proposed states produced by all generator
                arcs entering it. And since the new state of Property may be not always computed, the
                Property should implement two operations - Disjunction and Application. Disjunction
                operation should compute final proposed value, and Application operation should either
                change the color of the property to the color computed by the Disjunction operation, when
                it is defined, or leaves the state  of the Property unchanged when the result of the
                Disjunction operation turns out to be undefined.

                Example of Qualitative System Model Developed Based on McLN Graphical Modeling Formalism
            </p>

            <p>
                Presented below example is the McLN model of popular discrete dynamical
                system widely known as the "Dining Philosophers". States of properties of this system are
                considered qualitative and the mechanizm of behavior is based on Qualitative System Behavior
                Specification described on the page "". The McLN view of this model is presented in the
                figure 1.
            </p>

            <img class="center" src="Illustrations/Dining-Philosophers.png" />

            <p >
                <b>Figure 1.</b> Model of qualitative dynamical system: “Dining Philosophers”.
            </p>

            <p>
                In this example the model is implemented as the McLN, and thus in the form of
                a bipartite directed graph. Hence, all the properties of the modeled system
                which are the five Philosophers and five Chopsticks, depicted in the model as
                the big and small circles, respectively.
            </p>

            <p>
                According to observed behavior of the modeled system real Philosophers may
                be in four different stated: Contemplating, Hungry, Waiting for Availability
                of Chopsticks and Dining. Their behavior iterates through named four states
                where state Dining transitions to state Contemplating and circle repeats.
            </p>

            <p>
                Behavior of this model is driven by two external input events where the first one causes
                feeling of hungriness, and the second indicates that the period of Dining is ended with
                satisfaction and the philosopher may proceed with strolling and contemplating again.
            </p>

            <p>
                Both of these input events are generated by the Qualitative Dynamical System Modeling &
                Simulation Environment used for creating McLN models and simulation of their behavior.
                These input events are provided with the help of a list of tick/action pairs, called a
                State Driven Program. While, the program is being created and associated with a property
                whose state can change as a result of external input-events, during constructing of the model.
