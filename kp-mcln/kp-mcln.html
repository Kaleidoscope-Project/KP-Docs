                This page introduces the qualitative dynamical systems' graphical modeling formalism, referred
                to as "the Multicolored Logical Net", or the McLN. Created in the form of McLN, models are based
                on the notion of the bipartite directed graph, and, therefore, can be assembled on a computer
                screen.

                Elements of these   models are representations of such elements of
                the modeled systems as the Properties, Conditions, triggering changes of state of the
                Properties, Dependencies of the state of Conditions on the state of Properties and Dependencies
                of the state of Properties on the state of Conditions. Therefore, the McLN models can
                be, naturally, created as the graphical nets that are characterized by their structure, and
                by the mechanism of reproducing behavior of the modeled systems that is enabled by endowing
                the elements of the structure with the ability to perform operations of the Algebra of
                Symbols.

            <p>
                Property nodes represent properties and states of the properties of the modeled systems, where
                the states are denoted as solid color that fills the circles or the hexagons. Conditions nodes
                are the conditions of changes of states of Property nodes. They represent facts of existence of
                expected situations that cause Property nodes, dependent on occurrence of situations, to change
                their states. Hence, states of Conditions nodes may either represent the fact that the expected
                situation is recognized or the fact that it is not recognized. These states are represented as
                the solid white color with symbol "+" drawn on it, or as just the solid gray color, respectively.
            </p>
<!--            <p>-->
<!--                Big circles () or hexagons are the Properties. They represent properties and states of the properties of the-->
<!--                modeled systems, which are indicated as solid color that fills the node. Small circles are the-->
<!--                Conditions. They represent fact of existing of expected situations and cause dependent on-->
<!--                occurrence of sitiations Property nodel to changes their states. Hence, their states may either represent-->
<!--                fact that expected situation is recognized or the fact that it is not recognized. These-->
<!--                states are represented as the solid white or gray colors, respectively.-->
<!--            </p>-->

<!--            <p>-->
<!--                Big nodes represent Properties of the modeled systems, states of which are indicated as-->
<!--                solid color that fills the circles. Small circles are the facts state of which may either-->
<!--                assert that: “The expected situation recognized” or that “The expected situation not-->
<!--                recognized”. These states are represented as a solid white (situation is recognized) or-->
<!--                gray (situation is not recognized) color, that fills the circles of the Condition node,-->
<!--                respectively.-->
<!--            </p>-->

            <p>
                Arcs directed from a group of the Property nodes to a Condition node represent dependence of the fact
                of recognition of an expected situation on a certain combination of states of Property nodes. These
                arcs are marked with the colored dots, particular colors of which are those expected states
                that the arcs’ input Properties should have in order for the situation to be deemed as
                existing and recognized.
            </p>

            <p>
                Arcs directed from a Condition node to some Property nodes represent dependence
                of the state of the Property nodes on the fact of the existence of the expected situation. These
                arcs have a small arrow heads marked with that colors of the proposed states which
                the arcs' output Property nodes should take when the state of the Condition node indicates the fact
                that the expected situation exists.
<!--                is generated as the proposed state of-->
<!--                the Property nodes depending on the state of the Fact.-->
<!--                designated by the color of that state-->
            </p>

            <p>
                So, the structure of the McLN literally means that the state of each Condition node depends on
                the state of one or more of its input Property nodes, characterizing a particular expected situation
                determined by the colors of the dots marking the Properties' output arcs.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the same
                time, the state of each Property node depends on the state of
                one or more of its input Condition nodes, and takes state represented by the color of the arrowhead
                of the arc directed form the Condition node to the dependent Property node in case when the state of
                the Condition indicates that all its input Properties represent expected situation denoted by
                the marks of their output arcs.
                <br><br>
                <em>Exclusion</em>>: Case when the state of Condition indicates that the expected situation is
                not recognized, or case when two or more Conditions suggest that dependent on different recognized
                situations Property should take different states are ignored and current state of the dependent
                property stays unchanged.

                The Mechanism of the McLN model's Behavior
            </p>

            <p>
                Unlike the mechanism for computing the XDNF expression, based on the idea of traversing the
                expression calculation tree obtained as a result of grammatical analysis of the expression,
                or the mechanism for computing the matrix equation of the qualitative system state, performed
                as first multiplying the System State Vector by the Situations Recognition Matrix, then
                multiplying the Facts Vector by the Generation Matrix producing the Proposed Values Vector,
                and finally applying the Application operation to it to get the System Next State Vector,
                <em>the process of transformation of the current state of the McLN model into its next state is
                controlled by the flow of events.</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                For that purpose the Simulation Engine, that provides the work of the McLN model has and
                maintains the Event Queue. Whereas, the model behavior, also provided by the Simulation Engine,
                consists of two parts: "Model Initialization" and "Model Behavior Controller".
            </p>

            <p class="second-level-section-header">
                Part: Model Initialization
<!--                Organization of the McLN model's Simulation Engine-->
            </p>

            <p>
                Part "Initialization" is executed only once. It first, identifies all situations present in
                the model existing as the result of assigning to Property nodes their initial state defined
                during creation of the model; and then places events in the Event Queue to inform the
                Simulation Engine that some of the expected situations exist and, thus, the process of the
                model's responses to the situations can begin.
            </p>

            <p class="second-level-section-header">
                Part: Model Behavior Controller
            </p>

            <p>
                Part: Model Behavior Controller has several tasks to perform. It checks whether the Event Queue
                contains any events and if the queue is not empty - responds to these events, during which
                transforms the current state of Properties into their next states doing this for those properties
                changes of which require by the events which have occurred. Then it checks if just made changes
                of the state of the properties formed new situations and if yes checks if just arisen situations
                have dependent on them Properties. And if they have and the states of these Properties have to
                be changed, Controller creates for them Property State Change Events and places them in the Event
                Queue. This package of events will be processed at the next iteration of the Controller, during
                which the transformation of the states of the Properties, referred to in the events, will be
                carried out and the newly updated state of the model into its next state will be performed,
                and so on.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thus, the main content of the Model Behavior Controller is a process consisting of: changing
                the state of the Model Properties, recognizing the situations that have emerged as a result of
                these changes, determining the changes in the properties corresponding to the aroused situations
                and placing, in the Event Queue, of the Property Change Events informing the Controller about
                the need to change state of the properties that must be processed at the next iteration of
                unloading the event queue.

            <p>
                Although pure mathematically, the bipartite directed graph is merely two sets of nodes
                connected by the directed arcs, the McLN model of a qualitative dynamical system, structure
                of which is based on the bipartite graph, in addition to the roles assigned to the elements of the
                graph, described above, should also be capable of reproducing behavior of modeled
                system.
            </p>

            <p>
                And that means the graph should have in its possession a collection of functions associated
                with its elements. These functions have to ensure certain transformations of states
                of Property nodes, and the motion of their states from some Property nodes to others.
                And, thus, all that activity should be performed by the Property nodes, Condition nodes and by the both
                types of the arcs of the graph itself. And this is achieved by endowing each element of the
                model with the ability to perform the AoS operation, associated with it.
            </p>

            <p>
                When describing transformation of state of McLN Model to the next state performed by the
                part: Model Behavior Controller, it is best to consider: 1) elements of a model
                as some kind of simple discrete devices, 2) work of the model (i.e., its behavior) as
                the interaction of these devices, and 3) the mechanism for controlling the work of the
                model as the process of performing functions associated with these devices.
            </p>

            <p>
                Execution of the model assumes that the states of its all properties are always defined.
                Accordingly, performance of the operations of the elements of the model always begins
                with identifying situations present in the model.
            </p>

            <p>
                Arcs directed from Properties to Conditions are comparators. Each arc implements the Equivalence
                operation, which compares the color of its input Property with the color that marks the arc.
            </p>

            <p>
                Conditions perform recognition of the fact of presence of the expected situation in the model.
                Therefore, each Condition implements the Conjunction operation, whose task is to compute the
                conjunction of all the results of comparisons performed by its input arcs.
            </p>

            <p>
                Arcs directed from Condition to Properties are generators of the proposed state of their
                output Properties. They implement Production operation. The task of each such arc
                is to produce a proposed state represented by the color marking the arrowhead of the arc in the
                case when the state of its input Condition is the fact of the existence of the expected
                situation. Or, alternatively, to produce a proposed state represented by the color indicating
                that the expected situation is not recognized.
            </p>

            <p>
                Properties accept results produced by arcs directed to them from all Conditions. Each
                Property accepts state computed based on all proposed states produced by all generator
                arcs entering it. And since the new state of Property may be not always computed, the
                Property implements two operations - Disjunction and Application. Disjunction
                operation computes final proposed value, and Application operation either
                changes the color of the property to the color computed by the Disjunction operation, when
                it is defined, or leaves the state  of the Property unchanged when the result of the
                Disjunction operation turns out to be undefined.
            </p>

<!--                Thus, when it turns out that either the initial state of the model holds some combinations-->

                Mechanism of Interactions of the McLM Model With Outside World
            </p>

            <p>
                Like any other dynamic system, a qualitative dynamical system can interact with the world
                around it, thet is to experience the influence of the world and influence it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Analysis of changes in state of Properties of modeled qualitative systems allows us to
                notice two main reasons of causing their changes. These are changes caused by external
                processes that are observed as spontaneous changes in the state of some properties
                of the system that, like all other changes, participate in the formation of the situation.
                And changes in the state of Properties caused by internal processes of the model, the
                reasons for which are previously occurring changes in the state of Properties caused either
                by the dependence of these Properties on the expected situation, i.e., as a result of
                the process of simulating a change in the state of the model on the situation, or spontaneous
                changes caused by external influences. In both cases, changes in state caused by the
                dependence of the state of a Property on its own state that arose earlier, as changes
                caused by external influences, are perceived as spontaneous.
            </p>

            <p>
                Reproduction of spontaneous changes in the state of properties, the cause of which is not
                known and therefore not described in the Qualitative Systems Behavior Specification,
                is implemented in the McLN models by including in the description of those Properties
                that may act spontaneously, lists of rules called either the Time Driven Program and
                the State Driven Program.
            </p>

            <p>
                Properties that have a program associated with them are depicted on the model graph in the
                form of hexagons, where the number of ticks that must pass before it changes its current
                state to the state described in the program is depicted using a number placed inside the
                hexagons. This number is the countdown to the moment when the change of the state of the
                property caused by the program to occur.
            </p>

            <p>
                For example, all the properties located in the bottom row of Figure 1 are the ones that have
                a Time Driven Program, and that, therefore, they are depicted in the form of hexagons. And
                that the numbers shown inside these hexagons indicate that there are only two ticks left before
                the pre-programmed change of the state of these properties will take place.

                Presented below example is the McLN model of popular discrete dynamical
                system widely known as the "Dining Philosophers". States of properties of this system are
                considered qualitative and the mechanism of its behavior is based on the

            </p>

            <p>
                This, more comprehensive than the presented in Figure 1, McLN model consists of five property
                nodes, representing Philosophers that are depicted on the outer radius of the model as
                the big hexagons, and five property nodes, representing Chinese Chopstick, that are
                depicted on its inner radius as the big circles. It serves for reproducing behavior of five
                asynchronous processes causing fragmentary changes in the state of both types of the
                system's properties.

            <p class="third-level-section-header-bold-line-size">
                Structure
            </p>

            <p>
                According to specified behavior of the modeled system, Philosophers can take four successively
                occurring states: “Strolling and Contemplating” (blue), “Feeling Hungry” (red), “Dining”
                (magenta) and “Satisfied” (light green). Chopsticks may be in only two states -
                “Available” (green) or “Busy” (yellow).
            </p>

            <p>
                Transitions of Philosophers from state "Strolling and Contemplating" to state "Hungry",
                and from state "Dining" to state "Satisfied" happen for unknown reasons, which, therefore,
                are deemed as unexplained factors. All that is known about these transitions is only
                that both of these changes occur spontaneously, but always require that some small
                random time has to pass after the Philosophers acquire states causing these changes.
                These transitions are handled by the Simulation Engine as external events generated by
                the State Driven Program associated with each Philosopher node, which are depicted in
                Figure 2 as hexagons.
            </p>

            <p>
                Condition for philosophers to transition from state "Hungry" to state "Dining" is the
                situation that occurs when the philosophers are in the "Hungry" state and both Chopsticks
                located to the left and the right of them are in the "Available" state. Occurrence of
                this situation transfers such philosophers to state "Dining" and both Chopsticks to
                the "Busy" state.
            </p>

            <p>
                Condition for Philosophers to transition from state "Satisfied" to state "Strolling and
                Contemplating" is the situation that occurs when the Philosophers have finished dining
                and are in the "Satisfied" state. Occurrence of this situation transfers Philosophers
                from the state: "Satisfied" to the "Strolling and Contemplating" state and both Chopsticks
                to the "Available" state.
            </p>

            <p class="third-level-section-header-bold-line-size">
                Behavior
            </p>

            <p>
                In the initial state of the model, all Philosophers are walking in the garden and are,
                thus, in the "Strolling and Contemplating" state. Therefore, simulation of behavior of
                dining philosophers starts as their transitions from the "Strolling and Contemplating"
                state and is performed as both driven by the external and internal events,
            </p>

            <p>
                Transition from the state: "Strolling and Contemplating” to the state: "Feeling Hungry"
                occurs for a reason not presented in the model and is therefore perceived as spontaneous.
                It is implemented as an external event generated by the State Driven Program that has
                a requirement to replace state: "Strolling and Contemplating" with the state: "Feeling
                Hungry" after the random number of ticks.
            </p>

            <p>
                Transition from the state of "Feeling Hungry" to the state “Dining” depends on the
                availability of both Chopsticks and is therefore determined by the moment of occurrence
                of the expected situation arising when both Chopsticks necessary for the beginning of
                the meal are in state “Available”. Simultaneously available Chopsticks allow Philosophers
                to start dining immediately. However, facing a case when either one or both Chopsticks
                are in “Busy” state, a particular Philosopher has to wait until one or both of his
                neighbors at the table to finish dining and release the Chopsticks they are using.
            </p>

            <p>
                Duration of dinner, as well as the duration of the walking in the garden, also depends on
                many factors unknown to the model; and is, therefore, also implemented as the operation
                of the State Driven Program, which replaces state: “Dining” with the state: “Satisfied”,
                in a random number of ticks after the dining has begun.
            </p>

            <p>
                While in the “Satisfied” state, Philosophers release both Chopsticks to the table and,
                thus, make them available to the other Philosophers who may be at the table to the
                left or to the right of them, and move to the state: "Strolling and Contemplating”,
                starting, thus, a new iteration of the strolling and dining.
            </p>

                This section is located on the page: "Qualitative Dynamical Systems, Their Behavior and
                Mathematical Modeling Technique". It proposes a way of describing behavior of particular
                qualitative dynamical system by listing rules of dependence of each state of each property
                of the system on the state of groups of properties, occurrence of which causes
                transition of the dependent property from its current to the next state, which is
                deemed the "proposed state of the property", provided by the rule.
