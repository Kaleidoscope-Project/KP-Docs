            <p>
                This page is a brief description of the Qualitative Dynamical Systems Modeling
                & Simulation Environment, or QDS MSE. It is arranged as a number of screenshots of
                the application which demonstrate its major features, backed by short explanations.
            </p>

            <strong>Modes of the Application and Its Screen Layouts</strong>

            <p>
                The Environment is a full-fledged Java desktop application that utilizes McLN Modeling Formalism,
                described on the page:
                <span class="popup-link" onmouseenter="openPopup(event, mse01)" onmouseleave= "closePopup(mse01)">
                    <a class="popup-link" href = "../kp-mcln/kp-mcln.html" target="_blank">
                    <em>"Multicolored Logical Net Modeling Formalism"</em>.</a>
                </span>
                for design, development and
                simulation of qualitative dynamical system models. Respectively, the application can be
                set to operate in either the Development or the Simulation mode. In both modes menu item
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:bold">View&nbsp;=>&nbsp;Graph</span> or <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:bold">View&nbsp;=>&nbsp;Matrix</span> can be
                selected to represent the McLN models as either the bipartite oriented graph, or as the vectors
                and matrices, constituting models' vector state space equations.
                By default, the application is started in the
                Development mode and is set to represent a being developed model in the form of its Graph View.
                <b>Figure 1</b> represents the QDS MSE initial screen, presented at the start of the application.
            </p>

            <p style = "text-align: center;"><br>
                <img style="width: 500px; height: 300px;" src="app-screenshots-small/Started-Application-Small.png"/>
            </p>
            <p style = "text-align: center;"><b>Figure 1.</b> Started Application.</p>

            <a>
                The basic application screen layout includes following sections (from top to bottom):
                Menu, Toolbar, Status panel, the Design Space, that can be set in the Model Development or
                Simulation View mode, the Assisting Tools Area, and the One Line Message panel. The Design
                Space's Model Development View is the McLN Graph/Matrix View holder. In the usual case the McLN
                Graph View occupies the entire Design Space area. However, a developer, in addition
                to the McLN Graph/Matrix View, may open one of such three optional right side panels as:
                The Initialization Assistant, The Help Topics or the Preferences Setup panels, as well as
                one left side panel: Print Preview.
                The Print Preview panel, when open, takes the left and central parts
                of the Model Development View area to present its Print Control panel on the left and the Print Page
                panel in the center of this area.
            </a>

            <h4>The Development Mode</h4>

            <p>
                While in the Development mode, the Environment allows McLN model developer to create McLN model
                Graph, set the model's Properties in their initial state, initialize Arcs with their Expected or
                Proposed states, save the partially created or complete model on a hard drive, retrieve it, modify,
                and save again. The application thus produces a McLN file that is intended to be retrieved by the Space
                Exploration Mission application into its Robot Behavior Controller (see page: "Space Exploration
                Mission // An Agent-Robot Behavior Simulator"). <b>Figure 2</b> represents Design Space's Graph View
                filled with the
                Three Rules McLN model and the Initialization Assistant - a wizard-like tool - opened
                on the right side of the Design Space. <b>Figure 3</b> represents the same Three Rules model in
                the Matrix View.

                Developer switches Environment to the Development mode by selecting menu item
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Development => Set Development Mode</span>.
                Development mode enables:

            </p>

            <p>
                When in the Development mode, the Assisting Tools Area contains a Summary panel that lists a summary of
                the model elements by type, providing for each type the number of included in the model elements
                and the range of their Unique Identifiers - UIDs used so far.

                Presented in the Matrix View McLN model is drawn as five elements - three vectors and two matrices,
                described below in the order of the data flow in the model:

                    the state of Properties. It maps model State Vector to Conditions Vector.
                </li>
                <li> Conditions Vector is the representation of the facts of recognition of situations, present in the
                    State Vector.
                </li>
                <li> Generation Matrix is the representation of dependence relations of states of Properties
                    on the states of Conditions. It maps Conditions Vector to Final Proposed States Vector.

                <li> Final Proposed States Vector which is the representation of the computed next states of
                    the Properties that are supposed to be merged into State Vector before it is used as the
                    input of the model at the next simulation iteration.

                <em>Although both Creation and Modification menus are enabled while the Design Space is set to be in
                either Graph or Matrix View, all creating new or modifying existing model elements operations
                can be applied when the model is presented in the Graph View only. The McLN model Matrix View
                currently serves for visualization purposes only</em>.
            </p>

            <h4>The Simulation Mode</h4>

            <p>
                While in the Simulate mode, Environment allows the McLN model developer to test developed model behavior.
                When switching to Simulation mode the Design Space is set to the Model Simulation View and the Assisting
                Tools Area, located below the Model Simulation View is filled with the Property Selection, the Property
                Current State, and the Execution History Trace Log panels. These currently
                available tools are assisting in the McLN model development, debugging and verification. <b>Figure 4</b>
                represents a QDS MSE screen snapshot made at the time when the Environment is in the Simulation mode while
                the Help Topics panel's Running Model Examples topic is optionally open on the right side of the
                Model Simulation View.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p style = "text-align: center;"><b>Figure 4.</b> The QDS MSE in The Simulation mode. </p>

            <p>
                Developer sets the Environment to the Simulation mode by selecting menu item
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Simulation => Set Simulation Mode</span>.
                Accordingly, the toolbar buttons enabled in the Simulation mode are:
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Start</span>,
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Stop</span>,
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Step</span>, and
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Reset.</span>
                They allow the developer to control the simulation process.

                Clicking on the
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Start</span> button, activates the auto simulation process.
                This click disables
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Start</span> and
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Step</span>
                buttons while enabling the <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Stop</span> button.

                Clicking on the
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Stop</span>
                button, stops the auto simulation process and returns
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Start</span> and
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Step</span>
                buttons back to their enabled state.

                Clicking on the
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Step</span>
                button, executes only one simulation step at a time.

                Clicking on the
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Reset</span>
                button, resets the model to its initial state.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Simulation Analysis Tools, located below the Model Simulation View allow a developer to
                select all, or just a
                subset, of model Properties and analyse behavior of the model over time of its simulation.
                The Model Current State Panel presents each selected
                Property current state by providing its interpretation in the form of a statement. This interpretation
                includes Property name as the statement's subject and the current state of the Property's in
                the form of the statement's predicate. The Execution History Trace Log panel presents selected
                Properties states history over simulation time. Both panels are updated after each simulation tick
                in real time.
            </p>

            <h4>Printing Developed Model</h4>

            <p>
                QDS MSE allows the developer to be able to print the developed model. To activate the printing
                facility the developer opens the
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:bold">Project</span>
                menu and selects the
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:bold">Print Preview Panel</span> item or alternatively
                clicks the corresponding toolbar button.
                <b>Figure 5</b> represents the QDS MSE Design Space at a time when the Environment is set
                to print a developed McLN model. For the purpose of illustration this snapshot also presents
                the Property Setup panel open on the right side of the Design Space panel.
