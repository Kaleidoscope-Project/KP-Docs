            <p>
                This page is a brief description of the Qualitative Dynamical Systems Modeling
                & Simulation Environment, or QDS MSE. It is arranged as a number of screenshots of
                the application that demonstrate its major features, backed by short explanations.
            </p>

            <strong>Modes of the Application and Its Screen Layouts</strong>

            <p>
                The Environment is a full-fledged Java desktop
                application that utilizes McLN graphical modeling formalism for design, development and
                simulation of qualitative dynamical system models. Respectively, the application can be
                set to operate in either Development or Simulation mode. In both modes menu item
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:bold">View&nbsp;=>&nbsp;Graph</span> or <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:bold">View&nbsp;=>&nbsp;Matrix</span> can be
                selected to represent McLN model as either bipartite oriented graph, or as the vectors
                and matrices, constituting models' vector state space equations.
                By default, the application is started in
                Development mode and is set to represent developed model in the form of Graph View.
                <b>Figure 1</b> represents QDS MSE initial screen, presented at the start of the application.
            </p>

            <center>
                <p><br><img src="app-screenshots-small/Started-Application-Small.png"/></p>
                <p><b>Figure 1.</b> Started application.</p>
            </center>

            <a>
                The basic application screen layout includes following sections (from top to bottom):
                Menu, Toolbar, Status panel, Design Space, that can be set in Model Development or Model Simulation Views mode,
                Assisting Tools Area, and One Line Message panel. Design Space's Model Development View
                is the McLN Graph/Matrix View holder.
                In usual case McLN Graph View occupies all Design Space area. However, user, in addition
                to the McLN Graph/Matrix View, may open one of such three optional right side panels as:
                Initialization Assistant, Help Topics, or Preferences Setup panels.
                Print Preview panel, when open, replaces McLN Graph/View area by taking left and central area of
                Design Space on the screen to present Print Control panel on the left and Print Preview
                panel in the center of the screen.
            </a>

            <h4>Development Mode</h4>

            <p>
                While in Development mode, the Environment allows McLN model developer to create McLN Graph, set
                Properties initial state, initialize Arcs with their Expected or Proposed states, save partially
                created or complete model on hard drive, retrieve it, modify, and save again. The application
                produces McLN file that is intended to be retrieved by Space Exploration Mission application into
                its Robot Behavior Controller (see page: "Space Exploration Mission // An Agent-Robot Behavior
                Simulator"). <b>Figure 2</b> represents Project Space Graph View filled with
                "Three Rules" McLN model and the Initialization Assistant - a wizard like tool - open
                on the right side of the Design Space. <b>Figure 3</b> represents same Three Rules model in
                Matrix View.

                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Delete Model Elements</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                When in Development mode, the Assisting Tools Area contains Summery panel that lists the summary of
                the model elements by type, providing for each type the number of created in the model elements
                and the range of the UIDs used so far.

                Presented in the Matrix View McLN model is drawn as five elements - three vectors and two matrices,
                described below in the order of the data flow of the model:

            <ol class="justified-text">
                <li> The State Vector is the representation of the McLN model Properties current state.
                </li>
                <li> The Situations Recognition Matrix is the representation of dependence relations of states of Conditions on
                    the state of Properties. It maps model State Vector to Conditions Vector.
                </li>
                <li> The Conditions Vector is the representation of the facts of recognition of situations, present in the
                    State Vector.
                </li>
                <li> The Generation Matrix is the representation of dependence relations of states of Properties
                    on the states of Conditions. It maps Conditions Vector to Final Proposed States Vector.
                </li>
                <li> The Final Proposed States Vector is the representation of the computed next states of Properties
                    that are supposed be merged into State Vector before it is used as the input of the model
                    at the next simulation iteration.
                </li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Although both Creation and Modification menus are enabled while the Design Space is set to be in
                either Graph or Matrix View, all creating new or modifying existing model elements operations
                can be only applied when the model is presented in Graph View only. The McLN model Matrix View
                currently serves for visualization purpose only</em>.
            </p>

            <h4>Simulation Mode</h4>

            <p>
                While in Simulate mode the Environment allows McLN model developer to test developed model behavior.
                When switching to Simulation mode the Design Space is set to Model Simulation View and the Assisting
                Tools Area, located below the Model Simulation View is filled with following panels: Property Selection
                panel, Property Current State panel, and Execution History Trace Log panel. These are currently
                available tools assisting in the McLN model development, debugging and verification. <b>Figure 4</b>
                represents QDS MSE screen snapshot made at the time when the Environment is in Simulation mode while
                the Help Topics panel's Running Model Examples topic is optionally open on the right site of the
                Model Simulation View.

                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Simulation => Set Simulation Mode</span>.
                Accordingly, the toolbar buttons enabled in the Simulation mode are:
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Start</span>,
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Stop</span>,
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Step</span>, and
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Reset.</span>
                They allow developer to control simulation process.

                Clicking on
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Start</span> button, activates auto simulation process.
                This click disables
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Start</span> and
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Step</span>
                buttons while enables <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Stop</span> button.

                Clicking on
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Stop</span>
                button, stops auto simulation process and returns
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Start</span> and
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Step</span>
                buttons back to their enabled state.

                Clicking on
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Step</span>
                button, executes only one simulation step at a time.

                Clicking on
                <span style="color:#780000; font-weight:plain">Reset</span>
                button, resets model to its initial state.
            </p>

            <p>
                Simulation Analysis Tools, located below the Model Simulation View allow user to select all, or just a
                subset, of model Properties and analyse behavior of the model over time of its simulation.
                The Model Current State Panel presents each selected
                Property current state and provides its interpretation in the form of statement, including
                Property name as the statement's subject and presenting the value of the Property current state in
                the form of the statement's predicate. The Execution History Trace Log panel presents selected
                Property
                states
                history over simulation time. Both panels are updates after each simulation tick in real time.
            </p>

            <h4>Printing Developed Model</h4>
