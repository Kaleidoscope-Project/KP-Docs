            <p>
                While studying or modeling behavior of systems of interacting components,
                we describe their state in terms of states of properties of components of
                a system, and the system as a whole. So, behavior of these systems is
                perceived as the sequence of changes of states of their properties over time, and is explained by
                the existence of dependence of each following state of the systems on their state preceding the change.
                Such systems are considered - <em>dynamical systems</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Properties of some dynamical systems are measurable. Their states represent
                magnitude of properties and therefore can be denoted by numbers and deemed as
                <em>quantitative</em>. An obvious example of these systems is our solar system. State
                of this system is characterized by such properties of the sun and the planets
                as their mass, gravitational force and many more. Dynamical systems, all
                properties of which, chosen for studying or modeling their behavior, are
                <em>quantitative</em>, may be classified and referred to as <em>the Quantitative
                Dynamical Systems</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Meanwhile, properties of many systems may be often perceived as <em>qualitative</em>.
                Considering systems we can attribute qualitative assessments to their properties,
                and describe the state of the systems in the form of affirmative propositions.
                So, for example, one may say: “My car is red” or “This window is only slightly
                open”. These descriptions, in general case, contain: name of the component,
                optionally name of the property, and mandatorily the predicate part which serves
                as the qualitative assessment of state of the property of the component.
            </p>

            <p>
                Objectives of this page are: a) to describe dynamical systems all properties of
                which, chosen for studying or modeling their behavior, are <em>qualitative</em>, and which,
                thus, may be classified and referred to as <em>the Qualitative Dynamical Systems</em>,
                and b) to propose a way of specification of behavior of qualitative dynamical
                systems, that can be used when creating models of behavior of these systems.
            </p>


            <p class="section-header">
                Notion of the Qualitative Dynamical System and Feasibility of Their Mathematical Modeling
            </p>

            <p>
                Although the expressive power and flexibility of natural languages make it possible to describe any
                system in terms of its qualitative characteristics, not each of the systems perceived in that way may
                become suitable for studying their behavior by developing their mathematical models just because
                states of their properties were given qualitative assessments.
            </p>

            <p>
                In order for the idea to describe states and changes of the states of dynamical systems in the
                form of their qualitative assessments to be practically meaningful, that is, for they to be
                considered as qualitative dynamical systems which can be studied, or designed, by creating their
                dynamical models, these systems must not only be qualitative and dynamical. They also should be,
                in their essence, discrete, since the qualitative assessments attributed to them are discrete, and
                their behavior has to be reproducible in the dynamical models created for the systems. Or, in the
                other words, they just have to be discrete and modelable.
            </p>

            <p>
                Accordingly, the study of feasibility of modeling behavior of the qualitative dynamical systems,
                conducted by the Kaleidoscope Project,  has resulted in (1) defining the notion of the qualitative
                dynamical system, given in the form of the listing of all characteristics of nature and behavior,
                that should be inherent in all the discrete and modellable systems, that can be considered as the
                qualitative dynamical systems, and, thus, constitute the class of that systems, on the one hand,
                and (2) developing the qualitative dynamical systems behavior mathematical modeling technique that
                enables creation of mathematical models for any system of the defined class, on the other hand.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>A note</b>. Since, in practice, all systems, described on this and the other pages, are strictly
                discrete, dynamical and modellable, continuous repetition of classifiers “discrete”, “dynamical”
                and “modellable” may seem a bit redundant. Therefore, further on, they will be mentioned only in
                the titles of the sections and in cases when it is necessary to emphasize the fact that the
                qualitative system has one of these classifiers. Otherwise, they will be often omitted.
                Respectively, phrases like “qualitative dynamical system(s)” will also be often written merely
                as the "qualitative system(s)".
            </p>

            <p>
                The rest of the sections describe: characteristics of the qualitative  system, and content of
                specifications of behavior of qualitative systems that can be used at a time of developing their
                models, suggested by the Kaleidoscope Project.

                Details of Characteristics of Qualitative Systems are described in two sections:

                Characteristics of Nature of Qualitative Dynamical<br>Systems
            </p>

            <p>
                The nature of something is what it has become in the process of its creation, and what is practically
                impossible to change later. Therefore, different systems, regardless of what they are: living
                organisms or operating devices created by man, have and demonstrate different behavior. The
                character of this behavior is a manifestation of their nature, and thus, cannot be changed either.
                This section lists those characteristics of behavior, inherent in systems, that make it possible
                to classify them as qualitative systems and develop models of these systems utilizing the
                qualitative dynamical systems behavior mathematical modeling technique suggested by the Kaleidoscope
                project.

                <b>Qualitative Systems are Driven by Their Own Behavior.</b>
                According to the notion of the qualitative dynamical system, defined by the Kaleidoscope Project,
                all systems considered as the qualitative have their purpose and the goals to achieve.

                        All Qualitative Dynamical Systems, by their nature and definition, are the ones having
                        their own behavior, which is organized based on the purpose of their existence, and the
                        concrete goals of operation the systems are eager to attain due to, or despite, possible
                        influences of external systems and/or the environment.

                <b>Qualitative Systems May Interact With the External World.</b>
                The qualitative dynamical systems, just like many other systems may affect external systems or
                experience influence of everything that is going on around. But, unlike the systems driven
                exclusively by external input, they do not have a special “input channel” through which the
                influences could control their behavior directly. External influences on the qualitative systems
                (if they are a part of the organization of behavior of the systems) may only make modifications
                in the systems, perceived as the changes of their properties. For the observer "living in the
                world of that system", such influences are supposed to look like spontaneous changes of the
                state of the properties of the system, which are absolutely indistinguishable from the changes
                occurring in the result of the internal processes in the system. Accordingly:

                        The Qualitative Dynamical Systems are the self-driven systems, behavior of which
                        may include interactions with other systems and/or their environment where they
                        may produce changes in the state of other systems, on the one hand, and experience
                        changes caused by the other systems observed as the spontaneous changes of the
                        state of the properties, on the other hand.

                Studying processes of changes occurring in various systems, developing over a period
                of time comparable to the time of development of processes in all the systems around us,
                we perceive these processes as behavior of systems and always deal with two fundamentally
                different mechanisms causing changes in the systems and thus determining the character
                of their behavior. These are the processes developing as a result of continuous changes
                in systems caused by continuously acting forces of nature and processes formed of discrete
                changes produced by actions of limited duration. So.

                Depending on the nature of a particular discrete system, the number of possible states which
                the properties of the system can take, may be in the range from: just a few, or several, to
                quite many different states. Meanwhile, as of the notion of the qualitative system, the number
                of states which the properties of these  systems may take, is always reasonably limited.

                Characteristics of Behavior of Qualitative Dynamical<br>Systems
            </p>

            <p>
                While reasoning about behavior at the everyday level, we primarily pay attention to the
                actions that someone or something performs in respect to surrounding systems or environment.
                And that is understandable. As the actions are a way of interaction between people, between
                machines and between people and machines, they are always important. However, when studying
                behavior of the natural systems or phenomena, and devices created by man, we, in order to
                gain an understanding of character of their behavior, tend to reveal mechanisms that drive
                the behavior of the systems. Therefore, in that study, we are primarily interested not so
                much in learning the character of the actions of the systems (after all, often the same result
                may be attained by using different actions), as in identifying the causes that directly or
                indirectly induce activation of actions, and in those changes in the systems which these actions produce.

                Systems Behavior as Situations, Responses and Changes
            </p>

            <p>
                Considering the causes of changes occurring in the discrete qualitative systems of interacting
                components from the point of view of describing character of their behavior, one may explain
                behavior of these systems as: 1) emergence in the systems internal situations, resulted from
                activity of components of the systems and actions of the environment, and 2)  responses of
                the systems to the emergence of important for the systems situations. Accordingly, when
                describing behavior of the qualitative systemes, we pay special attention to the situations,
                responses of the systems to the situations and changes, produced as part of the responses.
                They are detailed as follows.
            </p>

            <p>
                (<b>o</b>) <em>Situation</em>  in a qualitative system (in contrast to the external situations that may
                arise around us) is simply a particular combination of states of a group of properties of
                the system characterizing important circumstances, present in the world of the system. Such
                combinations are formed as a consequence of changes in the state of the properties of the
                system caused by the earlier activity of the system itself, and/or the influence (or direct
                actions) on the states of the properties of the system by other systems, Emergence of
                situation in a system generally means accumulation of important changes in the state of the
                system that require it to respond to the formed situation by producing certain modifications
                either in the system itself, or in its environment, or in both.
            </p>

            <p>
                (<b>o</b>) <em>Response</em> is a certain way with which a certain system reacts to the
                situation arised, by activating certain action performed with the aim of producing required
                modifications corresponding to the situation, in the system itself and/or in its environment, and.
            </p>

            <p>
                (<b>o</b>) <em>Change</em> is the result of performing the action, activated as a part of the
                response of the system; where the change is observed as the appearance of a new state of
                property of the system, proposed by the system during its response to the situation.

            <p>
                In a formal way, the abstract perception of change of a single state of a single property of
                a system carried out as the response to a single situation can be considered as the Property
                State Dependence Relation (PSDR) and be schematically written as a chain of the constituents
                of the response. It can be viewed as the abstract piece of the process of behavior of a system:
            </p>

            <p style = "text-align: center;">
                “Change <= Response <= Situation”
            </p>

            <p>
                or shorter as /<b>C-R-S</b>/. This expression states that the occurrence of a particular situation
                S, in a system, is the cause of its response <b>R</b> to the situation <b>S</b>, which, in turn, is the
                cause of a change <b>C</b> in the state of a particular property of the system corresponding to
                the occurrence of the situation <b>S</b>. This chain of the relations is intentionally written
                as directed from right to left in order to evoke association of the scheme of dependence
                relations with the process of computation of state of a property, that might be presumably
                implemented in the form of mathematical expression of a model of a system. (For the

            <p>
                Described Property State Dependence Relation schema is a convenient abstract way of
                representation of the idea of existing dependence relation of an abstract state of a
                property on the emergence of an abstract situation. But it may have limited application
                when it could be necessary to consider how the particular responses of a system to the
                occurrence of particular situations could be used to construct a schema larger than
                /<b>C-R-S</b>/, describing behavior of a system as a composition of few or several particular
                responses to particular situations. In order to describe the connections of these
                particular responses in a description of the organization of the system's behavior,
                the elements of the description should be not just abstract ideas of dependency.
                They should have all the concrete elements participating in the response,
                allowing the description to explicitly identify each property by its name and each
                state as a certain constant used to represent a particular state of the property.

            <p>
                The practically useful way of describing the concrete dependence relations of the state of
                properties on the situation, enhancing the abstract idea of that relation described as
                the Property State Dependence Relation schema, is the method suggested by the
                Kaleidoscope project that is developed for creating a specifications of the behavior
                of qualitative systems. This method consists in representing the dependence relations
                of the state of a property on a situation in the form of a Correspondence.
                The Correspondences serve as the real constructive elements describing the behavior
                of concrete qualitative systems. When used for describing behavior of a system,
                they are supposed to be created for every concrete dependence relation of the state
                of property of a system on each concrete situation causing change in the state of
                the property. And each concrete Correspondence is defined to hold the content of
                the concrete dependence relation describing a concrete state of a concrete
                property on a concrete situation and hence is defined as a pair of the dependent
                and independent elements of the relation. The first, dependent element of the
                relation in this pair is the property and the constant representing the
                concrete state, called "proposed state of the property", which the property
                takes as corresponding to the situation, called "expected situation of the
                relation", described in the second, independent element of the pair. Whereas,
                the independent element of the relation is a list whose elements are the
                property included in the description of the group of properties, characterizing
                the expected situation and the constant representing the expected state of
                the property in the expected situation.

                The Correspondence, in Figure 1, describes the only correspondence of dependence relation

            <p>
                Proceeding with the idea expressed in the title of this section, one may say that when
                dealing with qualitative systems, the "complex" part of description of their behavior is
                the Correspondences. Correspondences describe dependent property, property's proposed
                state and the situation, which is also a list of properties. Emergence of situations makes
                dependent property to take the proposed state. However, as it was just discussed,
                Correspondence, in turn, serve as the simple building blocks of the larger structure -
                scheme of behavior of entire systems. Dependent properties described in Correspondences
                are listed as constituents of situations in other Correspondences and, thus, form a more
                complex structure. This structure can be called a composition, or the net, of Correspondences.
                It describes all the properties, all groups of properties characterizing situations,
                the structure of their connections in the system. And so, in other words, it is a description
                of the changes of the states of the properties of the system, which we perceive as the
                step-by-step process of behavior of the system. Illustration of the principle of connection
                of individual Correspondences in the scheme of process of behavior of a system is presented
                in Figure 2.

                stand for the properties. The structure of the links of Correspondence provides control over
                the process of behavior of systems and therefore can be called a  Scheme of Development of the

                nodes of the graph represent properties, is in that Correspondence connection graph explicitly
                shows all the possible ways of flow of “signals” from one Correspondence to the others and thus
                explicitly shows different trajectories of development of asynchronous subprocesses in the main
                process of behavior of a system. That may be useful for analysis of behavior of a studied system.

                Another outcome of the representation of the system in the form of the graph, whose nodes are

                the Correspondences and between the properties of the system.

                Two Basic Ways of Combining Single Correspondences
            </p>

            <p>
                Even without analyzing characteristics of behavior of qualitative systems, but merely turning
                to our own experience and recalling everything we know about situations and reactions to them,
                it is possible to say that when thinking of the organization of behavior of the qualitative
                systems as of consisting of standard elements, first thing that springs in the maid is the
                two natural way of connecting the Correspondences making them work together. And for that,
                it is necessary to realize just  two things:
            </p>

            <p>
                (1) that each situation may produce changes of the state of not only a single property; it may
                also act simultaneously upon several properties by causing them all to take either the same or
                different states, depending on the purpose and needs of a particular modeled system; and,
            </p>

            <p>
                (2) that state of each property of the system may depend not only on a single, but on several
                different situations; in case of the occurrence of such situations, the dependent property may
                take either the same or different states proposed by different correspondences
                of states of properties to different situations, which are explicitly specified in the
                Correspondences.
            </p>

            <p>
                Example of a fragment of a model of a qualitative system, illustrating both ways of composition
                of Correspondences, is presented in Figure 3 (for details on the presentation read section:
                Explanation of Modeling Formalism Used).

            <p>
                Figure 3 presents a fragment of a model of а qualitative system created based on the same
                modeling framework as Figure 1. Therefore, just like Figure 1, Figure 3 depicts Properties
                as large circles, which are in the initial states in the figure. Small circles depict facts
                of presence of situations in the system. And the lines connecting the situation Properties
                with the facts are marked with the small dots, colors of which determine the expected
                combinations of states of groups of situation properties, whereas, the lines directed from
                the facts to the Properties are marked with the small arrowheads having colors of the proposed
                states of the dependent Properties. The content of this figure presents composition of six
                Correspondences where Property P1, state of which, on the one hand, depends on the occurrence
                of three different situations (P2, P3), (P4) and (P5, P6, P7) that may set the state of the
                P1 as Red, Blue or Green, and which, on the other hand, itself is a one property situation
                that can cause properties P8, P9 and P10 to take states denoted by color Red, Blue and Green
                when P1 is in state Blue, Green or Red respectively.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thus, based on the behavior described so far and in accordance to its vision developed in
                the Kaleidoscope Project, the mechanism of behavior of qualitative systems is determined:
                a) by the Correspondences that explicitly describe dependence relations of states of properties
                on the emergence or disappearance of situations, and, b) by, not explicitly described, but
                implicitly present, in the state of the systems, dependence of formation of situations represented
                by combinations of the state of properties, change of which occurs as a result of changes in the
                state of properties, included in the description of these situations, when the changes of the
                properties characterizing situations were produced earlier as the result of response of the
                systems to the situations that has been formed earlier.

                Behavior as Step-by-Step Process of Transitions of State of System
            </p>

            <p>
                Taking into account all that has been described above, behavior of qualitative systems can be
                viewed as a process consisting of a sequence of steps, the content of which is always the same.
                Each step responds to the situations formed at the previous step, by performing modifications
                in the system corresponding to the situations being processed, results of which are observed
                as the fragmentary changes of the state of the properties of the system. And since the
                states of some properties can be included in the descriptions of the expected situations,
                the consequence of the changes in the state of such properties can cause changes of the
                situations presented in the state of the system.
            </p>

            <p>
                Depending on the current state of the system at each step, changes in the groups of properties
                characterizing situations subjected to modifications can cause:
            </p>

            <p>
                (a) emergence of situations, completion of formation of which was expected as a change of
                the state of one, more, or of all states of the groups of properties characterizing situations;
                and these changes happened during the execution of the current step;
            </p>

            <p>
                (b) update of states of groups of properties characterizing situations which are not yet
                entirely formed with one or more, but not the last, replacements of state of properties
                characterizing situations, that make the groups to proceed formation of the situations;
            </p>

            <p>
                (c) destruction of existing situations represented by combinations of state of groups of properties,
                that were formed in the past, but the result of changes of the state of properties of the groups,
                produced by the system during the step, caused the destruction of the combination of the state of
                groups of properties, since the properties, states of which have been changed, are included in the
                descriptions of the situation, so that new combinations of the state of properties no longer
                represent existing situations.
            </p>

            <p>
                Possible cases when the execution of the current step of the process has ended, but none of the
                combinations of the state of the groups of properties characterizing expected situation has been
                formed and therefore the next step of the process cannot begin is an entirely anticipated form of
                termination of the process. Such a stop of the process is simply an indicator that everything that
                should be done by the system as its response to the occurrence of a single or chain of situations
                has been done, and that thus the period of active behavior of the system has been completed. But
                such completion does not mean that the system has stopped acting at all. The activity of its
                components and other systems with which the system under consideration can interact continues. So
                sooner or later a moment should come when either in the result of the ongoing processes in the
                components of the system, or under the influence of the surrounding systems or phenomena, someone
                or several properties will spontaneously change their state and these changes will create one or
                several new situations that will revive the active behavior of the system.
            </p>

            <p>
                As it follows the description of the behavior of the qualitative system as the sequence of steps,
                two described factors determine the organization of behavior of the qualitative systems. They are:
                the way of connection of the Correspondences and the step-by-step mechanism of application of
                Correspondence forming the process of behavior of the systems as the dynamically  organized behavior
                of systems of varying complexity.
            </p>

            <p>
                The description of various forms of organizing the processes of behavior of the systems is described
                on the pages presenting approaches to different representations of models of the system, studied

                        The Qualitative Dynamical System is a discrete system of interacting components all
                        properties of which selected for studying or modeling the system are perceived as
                        qualitative, i.e., are described by assigning to them qualitative assessments expressed
                        in the form of affirmative propositions; whereas characteristics of the nature and
                        behavior, inherent in the system, make it possible to develop for it mathematical
                        dynamical models by utilizing modeling solutions proposed by the mathematical
                        modeling technique created for modeling these kinds of systems.

                All images, used in the Figures presented in the sections for illustrating their context
                of this page, are the snapshots made from the screens of the software application, named
                "Qualitative Dynamical Systems Modeling & Simulation Environment" QDS MSE, developed in
                the Kaleidoscope Project. Access to the complete description and downloading of this
                application is provided from the main page of the documentation. Content of this section
                describes only the way of representation of elements of models of the qualitative system
                used by the modeling formalism utilized in the  QDS MSE.
            </p>

            <p>
                Illustrations presented in Figure 1 and Figure 2 on this page are the fragments of models
                of unnamed example systems; whereas the figure 4 is the complete model of the qualitative
                system, called “Dining Philosophers”. These models are abstract views of qualitative
                systems created with the help of the development environment, called “Qualitative Dynamical
                Systems Modeling & Simulation Environment”. The graphical views of models of the qualitative
                system in this development environment are created utilizing the Multicolored Logical
                Net (McLN) modeling formalism (MF).
            </p>

            <p>
                So, according to the requirements of the McLN MF the Properties of a modeled system are
                depicted as large circles, the facts of the presence in the state of the system of expected
                situations are depicted as small circles, while the dependences of the state of facts on the
                existence of  situations in the system and the dependences of the state of properties on the
                state of the facts are depicted as lines connecting the properties that are elements of the
                situation with the facts and the facts with the properties that must change their state due
                to the occurrence of a situation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Qualitative states of the Properties of models are presented by the color of the circles.
                Therefore, the connections of the properties that are elements of the situation with the facts
                of the presence of expected situations are marked with the small colored dots having the colors
                of the expected states of the input Properties of the connections, described as the expected
                states of the Properties of situations specified in the Correspondences. The role of these
                connections is to be the “Recognizers of the Situations”. Whereas the connections of the facts
                to the dependent Properties are marked with the small colored arrowheads directed from facts
                to the Properties. The role of these connections is to be the “Proposed State Generators”.
                Colors of the arrowheads of these connections are those proposed states, specified in the
                Correspondences, that states of dependent Properties should take in the event when all input
                Properties of the connections of the Properties with facts appeared to have the same color as
                the expected colors of dots marking the recognizing connections.

            <p>
                Necessity to create specification of behavior of a qualitative system may arise in many cases,
                but the mains are 1) creation of document describing our knowledge on behavior of system gained
                in the process of its study, that is, as they now say, to create a hard copy of what has
                accumulated in our maid, and 2) development of models of behavior of qualitative systems created
                as description of knowledge on reasons of changes of states of properties depending on the
                occurrence of  situations in systems. This knowledge is contained in the Correspondences of the
                dependence of the state of properties on the facts of the occurrence of certain combinations of
                states of groups of properties characterizing expected situations. Therefore, the content of
                a Qualitative System Behavior Specification, or shorter QSBSpec, should, in essence, be simply
                a listing of the Qualitative Property Dependence Specifications, or shorter QPDSpecs, content
                of which should describe dependence relation of state of particular property of the system on
                all situations occurrence of which causes change of the state of the property. And accordingly,
                as each dependence relation is merely a set of Correspondences describing dependence of particular
                state of particular property on a particular situation, the content of the QPDSpec should be
                described as the listing of those Correspondences, where each Correspondence holds description
                of all expected situations occurrence of which causes change of the state of dependent property
                of the relation to the proposed state described in the Correspondences.
            </p>

            <p class="third-level-section-header-bold">
                Preferred way of description of Specification
            </p>

            <p>
                Being a process of "materialization" of ideas of ​​the studied qualitative system, in
                which abstract elements of the system and characteristics of its behavior, that have formed
                in our minds, turn into Qualitative System Behavior Specification, creation of this
                specification presupposes usage, in it, designations of components of the system, properties
                of the components, and states of the properties.
            </p>

            <p>
                But, despite the fact that such specification is created as a text document, application
                in the description of the specification of designations of these elements of names of components,
                properties and property states taken from statements about state of the system, written in natural
                language, may be too cumbersome and therefore difficult for editing and utilization of the
                specification. Contents of specification, in general, should include descriptions of dependence
                of the state of properties on the occurrence of situations and situations as the listing of pairs:
                property/state of the property. And since properties (and their states) described in some
                QPDSpecs as dependent should be described in other QPDSpecs as independent, and independent ones,
                on the contrary, should be described as dependent, identifiers of the properties and their
                states should be included in descriptions of different specifications repeatedly.
            </p>

            <p>
                Therefore, in order to avoid repetition of long text identifiers of the properties and
                their states, in the QSBSpec, the idea of method of denotation of identifiers, suggested by
                the Kaleidoscope project, is based on replacing the names of components of the systems,
                properties of the components, and long descriptions of states of properties, made in a natural
                language, with their short unique identifiers.
            </p>

            <p>
                So, the way of creation of the QSBSpec, described in this section and used in others, suggests
                defying the Specifications as consisting of two parts: auxiliary and main. Auxiliary part of the
                specification is created as two lists of pairs of the unique identifiers UIDs and their text
                equivalents. The first of these lists is a pair: (a property UID and a text description of the
                property name), which is created as a concatenation of the description of the component of the
                property and the property name. Whereas, the second list is also a pair. But, its pairs are a
                state of a property UID and a predicate part of the statement of the state of the property,
                which is the text describing the meaning of the identifier of the state of the property. Both
                of these lists are created in the process of studying the behavior of the system, as new
                properties, their states, and unique identifiers are added to its description. The lists are
                therefore the enumerations of all the properties of the system and all states of all properties
                that can be used when working with the system, on the one hand, and the means of interpretation
                of unique identifiers of properties and states of properties, when it is necessary, to replace
                them with texts in natural language, on the other hand. Content of the main part is the
                Specification itself. It is a list of QPDSpecs which describe the content of the correspondences
                of states of properties to  the situations in which the names of the properties and their states,
                given initially in natural language, then have replaced by their unique identifiers, introduced
                and added to the lists of auxiliary part of the specification at a time of creating these lists.

            <p class="third-level-section-header-bold">
                QSBSpec Structure
            </p>

            <p>
                Based on the proposed by the Kaleidoscope Project specification format, all unique identifiers
                of properties begin with the lowercase letter "p", followed by the index of a particular property
                in the list of UIDs of properties; whereas all identifiers of states of properties begin with the
                two lowercase letter, either "ps", that stand for “proposed state” or “es”, that is short of
                “expected state”. Both these abbreviations are followed by the index of a particular text
                describing the meaning of the state of a property, in the lists of UIDs of states of the properties.
            </p>

            <p>
                General structure of the specification of behavior of a qualitative system may be written as:

            <p>
                As the presented QSBSpec is defined as a list of QPDSpecs, where each QPDSpec is a pair,
                second element of which is a list of Correspondences, and content of each Correspondence,
                in tern, is again a pair, second element of each is a list of pairs describing expected situation,
                description of such construction in the form of an expression would be rather cumbersome.
                Therefore, in order to make the form compact, this description utilizes notation, used  in the
                Kaleidoscope project. In the accordance with this notation, presentation of the lists in the form is
                given  with the help of constructs:
                <b>L</b> <span class="column"><sup>n</sup><sub>i=0</sub></span>,
                <b>C</b> <span class="column"><sup>cn(i)</sup><sub>j=0</sub></span>,
                and <b>S</b> <span class="column"><sup>sn(i,j)</sup><sub>k=0</sub></span>
                that are the project’s proprietary way to denote list iterators of elements of
                the specification as bold uppercase characters <b>L</b>, <b>C</b>, and <b>S</b>, whose indices i, j
                and k, change from 0 to n, 0 to cn(i) and 0 to sn(i,j), respectively. Thus.
            </p>

            <p>
                Construct <b>L</b><span class="column"><sup>n</sup><sub>i=0</sub></span>
                represents a list iterator through all QPDSpecs, index i of which change from 0 to n, where n
                is the total number of QPDSpec in the QSBSpec.
            </p>

            <p>
                Construct <b>C</b><span class="column"><sup>cn(i)</sup><sub>j=0</sub></span>,
                is a list iterator through all Correspondences, index j of which change from
                0 to cn(i), where cn(i) is the number of Correspondences in i-th QPDSpec. And finally.
            </p>

            <p>
                Construct <b>S</b><span class="column"><sup>sn(i,j)</sup><sub>k=0</sub></span>
                stands for the list iterator through all the pairs: [variable/value] describing expected situation,
                index k of which changes from 0 to sn(i,j), where sn(i,j) is the number of pairs
                characterizing situation defined in j-th Correspondence of i-th PSDSpec.
            </p>

            <p>
                Elements p<sub>i</sub> and p<sub>i,j,k</sub>, in the presented QSBSpec are the unique identifiers of the properties
                of the system, and elements es<span class="column"><sup>t</sup><sub>i,j,k</sub></span>
                and ps<span class="column"><sup>t+1</sup><sub>i,j</sub></span>, are the unique identifiers of the states of
                the properties, where the es<span class="column"><sup>t</sup><sub>i,j,k</sub></span>
                stands for expected state of the property p<sub>i,j,k</sub>  at discrete
                time t, while the ps<span class="column"><sup>t+1</sup><sub>i,j</sub></span>
                stands for proposed state that the property pi should take at discrete time t+1.
            </p>

            <p>
                Adaptation of the QSBSpec to its application for creating models of qualitative systems is
