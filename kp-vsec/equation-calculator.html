                This page is an introduction to the Qualitative Dynamical Systems Modeling Technique that provides
                a way of defining  models of those systems in the form of a vector state equation. It lets you
                simulate behavior of the systems by running interactive computation of the equations and visualizes
                the process of the simulation. To begin, please, follow the explanation written beneath the
                cluster of the Simulation Control Buttons.

                    self-driven and input driven behavior. This  behavior also may be often viewed as

                    chaotic, but yet deterministic nature of behavior, observed in the systems. Identifying

                    <b>First group of models.</b> Group <em>"Full State Situations and Self Driven Models"</em> consists of
                    two models. Each possible combination of all states of the state variables of the models of this group
                    (presented as the State Vector of the equation) characterises a particular situation that may occur
                    in the modeled systems.
                    <br/><br/>

                    <em>Model-1.1</em> demonstrates a case when each state of the model is recognized as the situation
                    to which the model responds by transitioning to the next state, corresponding to the situation.
                    <br/><br/>

                    <em>Model-1.2</em> is a variation of Model-1.1 in which only some states of the model are
                    recognised as situations to which the model should respond, but the others are not.
                    <br/>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Second group.</b><em> Group "Partial Situations and Input Driven Models"</em> currently
                    consists of only one model.<br/><br/>

                    <em>Model-2.1</em> demonstrates a case where all state variables of the model are split into two
                    groups that may change independently. The model behavior, thus, is constituted of two independent
                    processes. In order to present this clearly, one process is finite while the other is endless.

                <p>
                    <b>Third group.</b><em> Group "Partial Situations and Mixed Input Driven Models"</em> consists of one

                    <em>Model-3.1</em> demonstrates a case where there are no explicitly separated processes. Instead,
                    there is only one process in which unpredictably occurring partial situations are the causes of
                    fragmentary, e.g. partial, changes in the full state of the model.

                    Observed behavior of a qualitative system is perceived as a process of occurrence of situations
                    in the system and its reactions to these situations, expressed in the execution of actions
                    that change the state of some properties of the system. Therefore, the task of the model,
                    reproducing the behavior of a qualitative system, is to systematically recognize
                    situations represented by combinations of states of groups of variables that have
                    arisen as a result of the previous behavior of the model and to make changes in the
                    current state of the model corresponding to the recognized situations.

                    Presented on this page, solution to modeling the behavior of qualitative systems is given
                    in the form of a vector state equation describing  the process of computation of the
                    correspondences "Situation -> Change of the State of Properties" as a composition of vector
                    operations and matrix transformations of the current state of the model into its next state.
                    The structure of the state equation and description of the process of its computation are
                    described in the sections to follow.

                    operation is targeted. This vector is considered as an active one. In order to emphasize
                    the active status of such a vector, the background of the currently active vector is
                    highlighted in the pink color.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When carrying out a simulation process, the Simulation Engine  presents changes in the
                    state of the elements of the active vector after every executed operation. For this
                    purpose each changed state element of the vector is highlighted with the
                    color corresponding to the color of the current, i.e., the usual or the active background
                    of the vector.

                <p>
                    The process of computation of the equation consists in performing a sequence of four
                    vector and matrix operations that transforms the content of the Current State Vector of
                    the model into its next state. Respectively, these operations are executed as four
                    successive steps which are carried out from right to left. They are.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Input Application Step.</b> The input application, optional step of computation of
                    the equation, is involved in the case when the state of some properties of the modeled system
                    can be changed by external effects. It is implemented in the model as executing the
                    "Application" (<) operation, which "injects" the values of the External Input Vector into
                    the Current State Vector of the model. This operation is expressed in replacing values
                    of the elements of the Current State Vector with the values of non-empty elements of the
                    External Input Vector. Result of this operation is  modified Current State Vector.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>First Computation Step.</b> The task of the first computation step is the transformation
                    of the Current State Vector of the model into the Recognized Situations Vector. It is
                    carried out as multiplication of the Current State Vector by the Recognition Matrix, and
                    is implemented as computation of each element of the Recognized Situations Vector by
                    applying two

                    <br><br>
                    First, the Equivalence operation is used to systematically perform the pairwise comparison
                    of the elements of the row of the Recognition Matrix (corresponding to the being computed
                    element of the Recognized Situations Vector) with the elements of the Current State Vector.
                    The results of these comparisons can be either the symbol "!" meaning that the operands of the
                    Equivalence operation have been compared, or the symbol "$" meaning that they have not been
                    compared.
                    <br><br>
                    Second operation - Conjunction is applied to all results of the Equivalence
                    operation. Its result can be represented by “!” symbol, indicating that all results of the
                    Equivalence operation are represented as “!” symbol and, thus, that the situation described
                    in the Current State Vector has been recognized, or, alternatively, as the "$" symbol which
                    means that at least one of the results of comparison of values of the Current State Vector
                    with its expected value described in the row of the matrix has not been compared and,
                    therefore, the situation is deemed unrecognized.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Second Computation Step.</b> The task of the second computation step is the transformation
                    of the Recognized Situations Vector into the Proposed State Vector. It is carried out as the
                    multiplication of the Recognized Situations Vector by the Generation Matrix. The technique of
                    this multiplication is implemented as computation of each element of the Proposed State Vector
                    by applying two
                    <span class="popup-link" onmouseenter="openPopup(event, vsp02)"
                          onmouseleave= "closePopup(vsp02)">

                    <br><br>
                    First, the Production operation is used to systematically take pairs consisting of the
                    element of the row of the Generation Matrix (corresponding to the being computed element
                    of the Proposed State Vector) and the element of the Recognized Situations Vector. The
                    result of processing each such a pair depends on the values of the elements of the pair
                    and may be computed as one of the symbols: “-” or “$”; or as the element of the row of
                    the matrix if it is a symbol of set <b>D</b>.
                    <br><br>
                    Then, the Disjunction operation is applied to all the results of the Production operation
                    with the intention to choose out of all of them the single final proposed value that
                    might be used as the next state of the element of the Proposed Values Vector. So, to
                    achieve that goal, the Disjunction operation starts with assigning to the final proposed
                    value its initial value as the symbol “$”, ignores all results of the Production operation,
                    represented by the symbols "-" or “$”, and identifies cases when two or more proposed
                    values appear as different symbols of the set <b>D</b>. In accordance with definition
                    of the model occurrence of different proposed values is considered contradicting and
                    to prevent this contradiction the Disjunction operation marks final proposed value with the
                    symbol “#”.
                    <br><br>
                    Thus, in the result, it may always happen that the final proposed value holds
                    either: a) the “$” symbol, when none of the expected situations are present in the state
                    of the model and recognized; b) the "#" symbol, when the conflict of the proposed values
                    is detected; and c) a symbol belonging to set <b>D</b>, when one, two or even more situations
                    are recognized and all produced the same valid proposed value, which can be used as the
                    value of the element of the Proposed Values Vector. Processing all these three cases is
                    accomplished by the last third step.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Third Computation Step.</b> This computation step is the last in the process of
                    computation of the equation. It is accomplished by the Application operation. And its
                    task is to check if the final proposed value is undefined and replace it with the
                    value of the corresponding element of the Current State Vector.
                </p>
