                This page is an introduction to the Qualitative Dynamical Systems Modeling Technique that provides
                a way of defining  models of those systems in the form of a vector state equation. It lets you
                simulate behavior of the systems by running interactive computation of the equations and visualizes
                the process of the simulation. To begin, please, follow the explanation written beneath the
                cluster of the Simulation Control Buttons.

                    Models That Can Be Chosen for Simulation

                    Prepared for the simulation, models present different types of behavior, such as: self-driven
                    behavior or combined self-driven and external input driven behavior. Behavior may also differ
                    by number of independent processes or demonstrate chaotic but yet deterministic character
                    behavior in which the entire behavior of the system is viewed as a single process identifying
                    the independent sub-processes in which is merely impossible.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All the models in this presentation are intentionally of limited size since the purpose of the
                    demo is not to show how big a qualitative dynamical model can be, but to demonstrate the principle
                    of transformation of the current state of a model into its next state. The models are organized
                    in three groups.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>First group of models:</b> <em>"Full State Situations and Self Driven Models"</em> consists of
                    two
                    model. Each possible combination of all states of the state variables of the models of this group
                    (presented as the State Vector of the equation) characterises a particular situation that may occur
                    in the modeled system.
                    <br/><br/>

                    <em>Model 1.1:</em> demonstrates case when each state of the model is recognized as the situation
                    to which the model responds by transitioning to the next state, corresponding to the situation.
                    <br/><br/>

                    <em>Model 1.2:</em> is a variation of Model 1.1 in which only some states of the model are
                    recognised as situations to which the model should respond, but the others are not.
                    <br/>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Second group:</b> <em>"Partial Situations and Input Driven Models"</em> consists of one
                    model:<br/><br/>

                    <em>Model 2.1:</em> demonstrates case where all state variables of the model are splitted into two
                    groups
                    that may change independently. The model behavior, thus, is constituted of two independent
                    processes. In order to present this clearly, one process is finite while the other is endless.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Third group:</b> <em>""Partial Situations and Mixed Input Driven Models"</em> consists of one
                    model:<br/><br/>

                    <em>Model 3.1:</em> demonstrates case where there are no explicitly separated processes. Instead,
                    there is only one process in which unpredictably occurring partial situations are the causes of
                    fragmentary, e.g. partial, changes in the full state of the model.

                <p>
                    Observed behavior of qualitative systems is perceived as a process of occurrence of situations
                    in the system and its reactions to these situations, expressed in the execution of actions
                    that change state of some properties of the system. Therefore, the task of the model,
                    reproducing the behavior of a qualitative system, is to systematically recognize the
                    situations represented by combinations of the states of groups of properties that have
                    arisen as a result of the previous behavior of the system and to make changes in the
                    current state of the system corresponding to the recognized situations.

                <p>
                    Presented on this page, solution to modeling the behavior of qualitative systems is given
                    in the form of a vector state equation describing  the process of computation of the
                    correspondences "Situation -> Change of the State of Properties" as a composition of vector
                    operations and matrix transformations of the current state of the system into its next state.
                    The structure of the state equation and description of the process of its computation are in
                    the sections to follow.

                    It is yielded by the Disjunction operation to eliminate a conflict that occurs when two,

                    transformed by the Generation matrix to different proposed values.

                    Qualitative Systems, Their Behavior, Modeling Technique and <br>the Behavior Simulation Process
                </p>

                <p>
                    Imagine a discrete action device, the state of which is characterized by a certain collection
                    of changing over time, discrete properties. When talking about the state or behavior of these
                    devices, we often merely list these properties in the form of affirmative statements giving
                    them, as they say, qualitative evaluations. So, for example, we may say: “My car is red”,
                    “The Earth is orbiting the Sun” or "The weather today is pretty nice". Therefore, following
                    the adopted terminology  the collections of properties depending one on another, and the
                    devices themselves, may be naturally classified and referred to as the Qualitative Systems
                    or the Qualitative Dynamical Systems. Characteristics of the qualitative systems behavior,
                    their modeling technique and the behavior simulation procedure are:
                </p>

                <p>
                    (a) <em>The behavior of a qualitative system</em> - is a process of discrete changes in its state over time;
                    (b) <em>The qualitative system modeling technique</em> - is the representation of these systems in the
                    form of space-state equation and the description of a way of computing a particular change
                    in the system by describing the procedure for computing the next state of the system as a
                    function of its current state; and (c) <em>The behavior simulation procedure</em> - is an iterative process
                    of reproducing the sequences of discrete changes in the state of the system, which begins from
                    the first iteration of computation of the state equation, based on the initial state of the model,
                    and then is being carried out through the repeated computations of the equation, in which the
                    next state of the system, obtained at the just performed iteration, is used as its current state
                    at the next iteration.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Since the process of computation of the space-State equations requires different manipulations
                    with the vectors in the symbolic space states, a number of algebraical operations with the
                    symbols are needed for accomplishing the transformations needed. These operations defined on
                    the set of symbols were discovered and are described in the next section below.

                    Described in the previous sections, vector equations are the mathematical models of the
                    behavior of qualitative dynamical systems, and the vector operations providing the computation
                    of these equations are the mathematical operations on the qualitative vectors i.e. vectors that
                    are the elements of the space of qualitative states of qualitative dynamical systems. Therefore,
                    just as the operations with vectors of a numerical space that are implemented as a
                    composition of operations defined on a set whose elements are used to represent numerical
                    characteristics of the system and, thus, are the numbers, the operations on vectors of
                    qualitative space have to be implemented as a composition of operations defined on a set
                    whose elements are used for representation of qualitative states of properties;  that is,
                    in the given case, on the set the elements of which are the symbols.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To satisfy the requirements of the vector operations described earlier, the Algebra of Symbols
                    is defined on a combined set of symbols, defined as the union of a set of domain symbols <b>D</b>
                    and a set of auxiliary symbols <b>X</b>. This allows to implement the computation of vector
                    equations as homogeneous (with no branches) process in which the conditional choices affecting
                    the result of the computation are made inside the operations as the static part of the definition
                    of the operations, i.e. at the level of mapping the arguments of the operation to its result.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The feasibility of constructing such a system of operations was explored in the framework of
                    the project described on this page and an algebraic system providing operations necessary
                    for implementation of operations on vectors in the qualitative space, called Algebra of Symbols,
                    was defined. The Algebra defines five operations necessary for computation of the qualitative
                    vector state equation. They are: <em>Application</em>, <em>Equivalence</em>, <em>Conjunction</em>,
                    <em>Production</em> and <em>Disjunction</em>.

                    Qualitative Dynamical System Equation Computation

                <p>
                    The process of computation of the equation consists in performing a sequence of five operations
                    that transform the content of the current state vector of the  system into its next state.
                    These operations are executed as five successive steps which are carried out from right to left.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first, optional, step of computation of the equation is involved in the case when
                    the behavior of the system is determined by external influences on it. It consists in
                    performing the "Application" (<) operation, which "injects" the values of the vector of
                    external influences into the vector of the current state of the system. This procedure is
                    expressed in replacing the values of the elements of the current state vector with the
                    values of non-empty elements of the vector of external influences. The result of the
                    operation is the modified current state vector.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The role of the second step is to multiply the current state vector by the Recognition matrix.
                    This step is performed as a procedure of 1) row-by-row comparison of the values of the elements
                    of the rows of the Recognition matrix with the values of the corresponding elements of the
                    current state vector and 2) further, following the comparisons, the computation of the n-ary
                    conjunction of the result of the comparisons, where "n" represents the size of the current
                    state vector and also the number of columns of recognition matrix. The result of this
                    transformation is the Recognized Situations Vector whose elements contain either the symbol
                    "!" meaning that all elements of the row of the matrix associated with the element of the
                    vector of recognized situations have been compared and thus the expected situation described
                    in the row of the matrix is considered recognized, or, alternatively, the symbol "$" which
                    means that at least one of the values of the current state vector has not compared with its
                    expected value and therefore the situation is deemed unrecognized.

                    The third step of the computation, is, like the second one, the multiplication of a vector by
                    a matrix. But now the transformation consists in multiplication of the just calculated vector
                    of recognized situations by the Generation matrix. The purpose of this transformation is to
                    map the facts of recognition of the situations, presented as symbols "!" in the elements of
                    recognized situations vector into the values of the vector of the proposed next state of the
                    system. Procedure of such state-generating transformation consists in the element-by-element
                    computation of the values of the vector of proposed next state of the system and, correspondingly,
                    is implemented as 1) production for each element of the recognized situations vector, values
                    located in the row of the generation matrix corresponding to that computed element and thus
                    finding all the values corresponding to all recognized situations, and 2) the choosing out
                    of all the produced values the only one which is going to be used as the value of the element
                    of the vector of proposed next state of the system.

                    being developed as part of the Kaleidoscope project - a Research and Development initiative
                    intended to explore the nature of the behavior of Qualitative Dynamical Systems and
                    opportunities of studying the behavior of these systems by means of creation of
                    mathematical models of their behavior. The project also includes creation of software,
