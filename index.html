            "The origin of this book goes back to a talk - I remember it as if it were yesterday - that
            I had in 1927 with a mathematics professor of mine, Dr. George D. Birkhoff, when I was a
            sophomore at Harvard. I remarked to him that I wished there were an algebra of language -
            an algebra by means of which one could calculate the answer to an argument instead of going
            to sea in an ocean of words. He said to me that there was, and told me of a book called "The
            Laws of Thought" by George Boole, published in 1854. I quickly sought the book in the library,
            and although it confused me, since I did not then know about later improvements in Boolean
            algebra, nevertheless, the fact that here was an algebra dealing with things like classes
            and statements, and operations like AND, OR, NOT, opened wide for me a most exhilarating
            vista - the possibility that all the language of thought could really become calculable
            like mathematics. This possibility has become more real than ever before because of the
            calculating power of automatic computers. So, I hope that the contents of this book may
            likewise stir the imagination and spirits of many readers".

            Decades later, another researcher, Gennady Melnikov, in his book "The ABC of Mathematical Logic",
            published in 1967, in the section: "Why Mathematical Logic Gravitates to Proper Logic", in a
            journalistic form expressed idea that despite the fact that Boolean algebra, originally created
            for calculating logical reasonings, due to development of many engineering branches of knowledge,
            has expanded its application as a means of describing and modeling discrete systems whose
            property states can, as in logic, take only two states. The author draws attention to the fact that
            in 1938 Claude Shannon used Boolean algebra for analysing and calculating relay circuits. And
            suggests that, since by the time of publication of the book, objects, whose elements are capable of
            entering into discrete relations (for example, electrical or electronic circuits), became
            widespread &mdash; "the mathematical logic should be either considered as the mathematics of the
            finite discrete qualitative relations, modeling structures, or as the science of discrete modeling
            of systems whose properties have finite number of states".

                Kaleidoscope Project is a pilot research and development initiative intended to introduce notion
                of the Qualitative Dynamical Systems and to explore feasibility of mathematical modeling of
                behavior of the qualitative dynamical systems by representing their qualitative dependence
                relations in the form of algebraic expressions. The Qualitative Dynamical Systems, the Qualitative

                <em>Page titled:</em> "Space Exploration Mission // An Agent-Robot Behavior Simulator", is also
                named after the application described on it. This application imitates the Research
                Facility that is monitoring state and actions of the remote robot-rover, whose controlling unit
                is implemented as Multicolored Logical Net (McLN). The page is created for testing if the
                expressive power of the McLN is sufficient for it to be used as a behavior controller.

<!--                This application is developed to be the object, behavior of which is controlled by the McLN-->
<!--                Controller.-->
