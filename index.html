                Kaleidoscope Project is a pilot research and development initiative intended to introduce notion
                of the Qualitative Dynamical Systems and to explore feasibility of mathematical modeling of
                behavior of the qualitative dynamical systems. The Qualitative Dynamical Systems, the Qualitative
                Dynamical Systems Behavior Mathematical Modeling Technique, and the Modeling Solutions proposed
                by the Kaleidoscope Project are described on the cluster of the webpages referred to in the course of
                description of the Project.

                describes basic ways of composition of these elements letting the models of the system to be capable
                of reproducing various forms of behavior, observed in the qualitative dynamical systems.<br>

                The next page, titled: "The Algebra of Symbol", is the description of the algebraic system,
                called "The Algebra of Symbols" (AoS), which is needed for computation of the functions of models
                of qualitative systems. The AoS is defined as part of Qualitative Dynamical Systems Behavior
                Mathematical Modeling Technique, described on the previous page. And it is used in the qualitative
                systems modeling formalisms descriptions of which are presented right after this page.

                a special case. It describes dependence of states of a single qualitative variable on the state of
                several groups of qualitative variables. This dependence is computed by a qualitative function,
                implemented
                in the form of algebraic expression written as the composition of operations of the Algebra of Symbols,
                structure of which is called Extended Disjunctive Normal Form (XDNF). Unlike the well known DNF,
                XDNF includes not only operations with such familiar names as Equivalence, Conjunction and
                Disjunction (which are also present in the Algebra of Symbol), but, in addition, has two more operations
                named: Production, and Application. Meaning and roles of all five operations is described on this
                page.
