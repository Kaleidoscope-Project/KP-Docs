                Kaleidoscope Project is a pilot research and development initiative intended to introduce notion
                of the Qualitative Dynamical Systems and to explore feasibility of mathematical modeling of
                behavior of the qualitative dynamical systems. The Qualitative Dynamical Systems, the Qualitative
                Dynamical Systems Behavior Mathematical Modeling Technique, and the Modeling Solutions proposed
                by the Kaleidoscope Project are described on the cluster of the webpages referred to in the course of
                description of the Project.

                Objective of this page is to introduce a notion of the class of Qualitative Dynamical System and to
                describe characteristics of the nature and the behavior of Qualitative  Systems,
                constituting the basis for creation of mathematical models of these systems. This page
                identifies atomic element of the behavior of the systems and
                describes the ways of composition of the elements letting the model of a system to be able
                to reproduce various forms of behavior observed in the Qualitative Dynamical Systems being modeled.

                The page introduces Qualitative Dynamical Systems Behavior Mathematical Modeling Technique
                developed by the Kaleidoscope Project and describes modeling solutions proposed by the Modeling
                Technique. As the behavior of dynamical systems is generally perceived as a sequence of observed
                transitions of states of properties of the systems over time, modeling solutions suggest:
                <br><br>
                (a) defining a model as a collection of variables that represent qualitative
                properties of modeled system and therefore are supposed to take qualitative
                values;<br><br>
                (b) suggests mechanism of computation of changes of values of the state variables of the models in
                the form of state function associated with every variable; and provides the
                algebraic system, elements of carrier set of which could be used
                to represent qualitative values of the variables, while the operations defined
                on the set can be used for carrying out steps of computation of the functions.

                The next page, titled: "The Algebra of Symbol", is the description of the Algebraic System,
                called "The Algebra of Symbols" (AoS), which is needed for computation of the functions of models
                of qualitative systems. The AoS is defined as part of QDSs mathematical modeling technique, described on
                the previous page. And it is used in the qualitative systems modeling formalisms description
                of which follows right after this page.

                expression of which is defined in the form of Extended Disjunctive Normal Form (XDNF). Unlike
                simple DNF, XDNF includes not only familiar operations Conjunction and Disjunction which are
                also present in the Algebra of Symbol, but also three other operations of the Algebra called:
                Equivalence, Production, and Application. Meaning of these operations is described on the
