            "The origin of this book goes back to a talk - I remember it as if it were yesterday - that I
            had in 1927 with a mathematics professor of mine, Dr. George D. Birkhoff, when I was a sophomore
            at Harvard. I remarked to him that I wished there were an algebra of language - an algebra by
            means of which one could calculate the answer to an argument instead of going to sea in an ocean
            of words. He said to me that there was, and told me of a book called "The Laws of Thought" by
            George Boole, published in 1854. I quickly sought the book in the library, and although it
            confused me, since I did not then know about later improvements in Boolean algebra, nevertheless,
            the fact that here was an algebra dealing with things like classes and statements, and operations
            like AND, OR, NOT, opened wide for me a most exhilarating vista - the possibility that all the
            language of thought could really become calculable like mathematics. This possibility has become
            more real than ever before because of the calculating power of automatic computers. So, I hope
            that the contents of this book may likewise stir the imagination and spirits of many readers".

            Decades later, another researcher, Gennady Melnikov, in his book "The ABC of Mathematical Logic",
            published in 1967, in the section: "Why Mathematical Logic Gravitates to Proper Logic", in a
            journalistic form expressed his observation that despite the fact that Boolean algebra, originally created
            for calculating logical reasonings, due to development of many engineering branches of knowledge,
            has expanded its application as a means of describing and modeling discrete systems whose
            property states can, as in logic, take only two states. The author draws attention to the fact that
            in 1938, Claude Shannon used Boolean algebra for analysing and calculating relay circuits. And
            suggests that: "Since by the time of publication of the book, objects, whose elements are capable of
            entering into discrete relations (for example, electrical or electronic circuits), became
            widespread &mdash; the mathematical logic should be either considered as the mathematics of the
            finite discrete qualitative relations, modeling structures, or as the science of discrete modeling
            of systems whose properties have finite number of states". (<em>Unfortunately, this book, written
