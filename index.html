                Kaleidoscope Project is a pilot research and development initiative intended to introduce notion
                of the Qualitative Dynamical Systems and to explore feasibility of mathematical modeling of
                behavior of the qualitative dynamical systems. The Qualitative Dynamical Systems, the Qualitative
                Dynamical Systems Behavior Mathematical Modeling Technique, and the Modeling Solutions proposed
                by the Kaleidoscope Project are described on the cluster of the webpages referred to in the course of
                description of the Project.

                The page introduces qualitative systems modeling solutions found by the Kaleidoscope Project
                in the course of exploration
                of feasibility of studying qualitative systems by means of developing models and
                simulation of behavior of these systems.<br>

                As the behavior of dynamical systems is generally perceived as a sequence of observed
                transitions of states of properties of the systems over time, modeling solutions suggest:
                <br>
                a) defines a model as a collection of variables that represent qualitative
                properties of modeled system and therefore are supposed to take qualitative
                values; b) suggests mechanism of computation of changes of values of the variables in
                the form of state function associated with every variable; and providing an
                algebraic system elements of carrier set of which could be used
                to represent qualitative values of the variables, while the operations defined
                on the set should be used for carrying out steps of computation of the functions.

                In addition to the internet resources, mentioned above, which describe and represent the Qualitative
                Dynamical Systems Modeling Techniques two following pages provide a number of screenshots

                software developed in the Kaleidoscope project for supporting creation and simulation
                of the McLN models.

                The page, titled: “Qualitative Dynamical Systems Modeling & Simulation Environment - [Brief
                Description With Some Screenshots]”,
                presents several snapshots of the UI of the application, named in the title of the page.
                This application is
                a development tool consisting of a) Graphical Creator/Editor where user can create the McLN model
                and b) the McLN Model Simulator that lets user start, stop and execute the model step-by-step,
                as well as to reset the model into its initial state.
